Qtractor - An Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer
----------------------------------------------

ChangeLog


GIT HEAD

- Always reset all internal dedicated MIDI controllers,
  eg. MIDI track volume (CC#7) and panning (CC#10), on
  Transport/Panic and after rendering export to audio
  (ie. Track/Export Tracks/Audio...) as needed to reset
  MIDI instrument plugins to nominal session state.

- Fix, detect and preserve MIDI Bank-select method across
  MIDI track/clips editing operations. (EXPERIMENTAL)

- Fixed MIDI track and clip note min/max display range
  while recording and also when duplicating tracks.

- Added "All files (*.*)" filter to every file requestor
  dialog, wherever missing. (EXPERIMENTAL)

- The tiny zoom-magnifier icons have been revamped.


0.9.0  2018-03-22  Early Spring'18 Beta.

- New View/Options.../Plugins/Experimental/Show plugins on
  track list/left pane option is in effect on tracks that
  are tall enough in height for their plugins list to fit
  on the Bus column.

- Fixed a day-zero bug over the MIDI Insert (Send/Return)
  pseudo-plugin, which was duplicating MIDI events onto
  the next LV2 plugin in chain, causing strange hanging
  notes, mutes, retriggerings and what not.

- MIDI track and clip note min/max range display now fixed.

- MIDI Program Change events (PC) now have their proper
  program number as parameter, instead of value, on the
  internal MIDI event representation.

- Merging MIDI clips while on SMF Format 0 has been fixed:
  was merging always onto the same MIDI channel (2), most
  often the wrong one, resulting in an empty or blank clip.

- When importing from standard MIDI files (SMF), set track
  names from Mtrk TRACKNAME meta-events instead of filename.

- Avoid asking to save as to existing or just newly created
  clip file-names, whenever possible.

- Disable singleton/unique application instance setup logic
  when the display server platform is not X11.

- Whether to use native file browser/requester dialogs is
  now an effective option when launching under NSM session
  management (was once disabled initially).

- Content files are now saved as symlinks when saving to
  JACK and/or NSM session directories/folders.

- Trying to get CC14 MSB+LSB (course+fine) running status
  on, no matter whether each pairing event are under 200ms
  apart.

- Possible VST plug-in GUI reparenting hack/fix on Qt5/Xcb.


0.8.6  2018-01-30  Winter'18 Beta.

- Added LV2_UI_updateRate option support.

- Added brand new option to deactivate plugins only if they
  can produce sound cf. main menu Track/Auto Deactivate (by
  Andreas Müller aka. schnitzeltony, thanks).

- Workaround native file dialogs hang up by setting parent
  widget to NULL; it should be noted that dialogs now get
  an own entry in the task-bar (also by Andreas Müller aka.
  schnitzeltony, thanks).

- Added ARM NEON acceleration support (by Andreas Müller aka.
  schnitzeltony, thanks).

- Track count "limit" and a "Delta" mode flag, for momentary
  and encoded controllers support, have been added to MIDI
  Controllers generic mapping (cf. View/Controllers...; after
  an original pull-request by Holger Dehnhardt, thanks).

- A little hardening on the configure (autoconf) macro side.

- Pinned current/hi-lighted track dangling after removal.

- An anti-flooding timer is now in place in MIDI Controller
  assignment (aka. MIDI learn) dialog.

- Add MMC Track input monitor support.

- New user preference option: View/Options.../General/Options
  /Reverse keyboard modifiers role (Shift/Ctrl), applied to
  main transport re-positioning commands: Transport/Backward,
  Forward, etc.

- VST Time/Transport information is now also updated as on
  playing when in audio export aka. freewheeling mode.

- LXVST_PATH environment variable now takes precedence over
  VST_PATH as Linux-native VST plug-ins search path.

- MIDI Controllers mapped to non-toggling shortcuts now work
  as one-shot triggers, independent of MIDI event value.


0.8.5  2017-12-04  Autumn'17 Beta.

- Audio clip gain and panning properties are now taken into
  consideration when hash-linking (aka. ref-counting) their
  back-end buffers.

- New out-of-process plug-in inventory scan and cache option,
  replacing the old (aka. dummy) VST plug-in scan option and
  extending its function to all other plug-in types: LADSPA,
  DSSI and also LV2 (cache only).

- A File System browser and tree-view is finally integrated
  as a dockable-widget on the main application window (cf.
  main menu View / Window / File System).

- Drag-and-dropping of session, audio and MIDI files over
  the main track-list (left pane) is now possible, allowing
  for yet another quick means to open a new session or add
  new tracks to the current session.

- MIDI input/capture time-stamping has been fixed as much
  to avoid missing inbound events, when play-head is near
  the loop-end point and the loop-start is set below the
  absolute first half-a-second (<0.5sec).
  
- LV2 Time/Transport speed information is now set on rolling
  when in audio export aka. freewheeling mode.

- Added *.SF3 to soundfont instrument files filter, on View 
  > Instruments... > Import... file dialog.

  track list/left pane option has been added.


0.8.4  2017-09-20  End of Summer'17 Beta.

- Assigned MIDI Controllers to plug-in's Activate switch are
  now finally saved and (re)loaded properly across sessions.

- Audio clip panning option property is now being introduced.

- Out-of-process (aka. dummy) VST plug-in inventory scanning
  now restarts automatically and resumes processing in case
  of a premature exit/crash; VST plug-in inventory scan/cache
  persistency is now in place.

- Desktop entry specification file is now finally independent
  from build/configure template chains.

- Updated target path for freedesktop.org's AppStream metainfo
  file (formerly AppData).

- Changing the View/Options.../Display/Custom/Style theme
  takes effect immediately unless it's back to "(default)".

- Slightly slower but better approximation to IEEE 32bit
  floating point cubic root ie. cbrtf().


0.8.3  2017-06-30  Stickiest Tauon Beta.

- Make sure any just recorded clip filename is not reused
  while over the same track and session. (CRITICAL)

- LV2 Plug-in worker/schedule interface ring-buffer sizes
  have been increased to 4KB.

- Fixed track-name auto-incremental numbering suffix when
  modifying any other track property.

- WSOLA vs. (lib)Rubberband time-stretching options are now
  individualized on a per audio clip basis.
  
- Long overdue, some brand new and fundamental icons revamp.

- Fixed a tempo-map node add/update/remove rescaling with
  regard to clip-lengths and automation/curve undo/redo.

- Fixed a potential Activate automation/curve index clash,
  or aliasing, for any plug-ins that change upstream their
  parameter count or index order, on sessions saved with
  the old plug-in versions and vice-versa.


0.8.2  2017-05-10  Stickier Tauon Beta.

- Track-name uniqueness is now being enforced, by adding
  an auto-incremental number suffix whenever necessary.

- Attempt to raise an internal transient file-name registry
  to prevent automation/curve files to proliferate across
  several session load/save (re)cycles.

- Track-height resizing now meets immediate visual feedback.

- A brand new user preference global option is now available:
  View/Options.../Plugins/Editor/Select plug-in's editor (GUI)
  if more than one is available.

- More gradient eye-candy on main track-view and piano-roll
  canvases, now showing left and right edge fake-shadows.

- Fixed the time entry spin-boxes when changing time offset
  or length fields in BBT time format that goes across any
  tempo/time-signature change nodes.

- French (fr) translation update (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).


0.8.1  2017-02-17  Sticky Tauon Beta.

- The View/Options.../Display/Dialogs/Use native dialogs
  option is now set initially off by default.

- All tempo and time-signature labels are now displayed
  with one decimal digit, as it was in mostly everywhere
  else but the time ruler/scale headers.

- JACK transport tempo and time-signature changes are now
  accepted, even though playback is not currently rolling;
  also, changing (JACK) Timebase master setting (cf.View/
  Options.../General/Transport/Timebase) will take effect
  immediately, not needing nor warning for session restart
  anymore.
 
- Track/Navigate/Next and Previous menu commands, finally
  fixed to wrap around the current track list.

- Current session (JACK) transport mode option switching is
  now being made accessible, from the main menu and drop-down
  toolbar buttons, as well as user configurable PC-keyboard
  and/or MIDI controller shortcuts (cf. Transport/Mode/None,
  Slave, Master, Full).

- Fixed some auto-backward play-head position flip-flopping,
  when opening a new session while the previous was still on
  rolling/playing state, hopefully.
  
- Added French man page (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).

- MIDI clip changes are now saved unconditionally whenever
  the editor (piano-roll) is closed or not currently visible.

- Audio clip peak/waveform files re-generation performance,
  scalability and resilience have been slightly improved.

- Some sanitary checks have been added to audio clip peak/
  waveform re-generation routine, as much to avoid empty,
  blank, zero or negative-width faulty renderings.

- Do not reset the Files tree-view widgets anymore, when
  leaving any drag-and-drop operation (annoyingly, all
  groups and sub-groups were being closed without appeal).

- Make builds reproducible byte for byte, by getting rid of
  the configure build date and time stamps.


0.8.0  2016-11-21  Snobbiest Graviton Beta.

- MIDI clip tools redo/undo processing refactored as much to
  avoid replication over multiple hash-linked clips; MIDI clip
  editor's floating selection/anchor event stability has been 
  also improved, in regard to MIDI tools processing range. 

- Auto-backward play-head location, when playback was last
  started, is now shown on main track-view, as a momentary
  dark-red vertical line marker.

- LV2 plug-in parameter optimization: stuff consecutive
  series of plug-in's parameter value changes, as much as
  possible into one single undo/redo command.

- LV2_STATE__StateChanged is now recognized as a regular
  atom notification event and raising the current session
  dirty flag, as normal behavior.

- Adjusting clip selection edges is now possible and honored
  while on the the main track-view canvas.

- Audio peak file caching and rendering, as far as audio
  clip wave-forms are concerned, have been refactored and
  optimized a couple of notches higher, on the ephemeral
  and rather marginal throughput front ;).

- Fixed a potential crash on the singleton/unique application
  instance setup.

- Edit/Select Mode tool-buttons moved into single drop-down
  tool-button on the main and MIDI editor's tool-bar.

- Do not reset the current clip selection when updating the
  main track-view extents eg. while zooming in or out.

- Automation curve node editing auto-smoothing revisited;
  also fixed input MIDI RPN/NRPN running status processing,
  which was crippling some plug-in automation curve nodes,
  when saved in high-resolution 14-bit mode.

- Fixed the visual play-head position (vertical red line)
  while zooming in or out horizontally.

- Almost complete overhaul on the configure script command
  line options, wrt. installation directories specification,
  eg. --prefix, --bindir, --libdir, --datadir and --mandir.

- LV2 Plug-in worker/schedule fix: make request/response
  ring-buffer writes in one go, hopefully atomic (suggested
  patch by Stefan Westerfeld, while on SpectMorph, thanks).


0.7.9  2016-09-21  Snobbier Graviton Beta

- JACK buffer-size change handling has been deeply improved,
  now doing an immediate session restart, while preserving all
  external connections as much as possible.

- Introducing an audio and MIDI metronome anticipatory offset,
  kind of latency compensation, to respective option settings
  cf. View/Options.../Audio, MIDI/Metronome/Offset (latency).

- Fixed LADSPA plug-in preset switching, incidentally broken
  as NOP, ever since late Haziest Photon's crash-landed.

- MIDI Track/Instrument cascading menus have been found empty
  broken on Qt5 builds, now fixed.

- MIDI RPN/NRPN running status and RPN NULL reset command
  are now supported (input only).

- Fixed a sure immediate crash on removing audio buses that
  are current targets of any active Aux-send inserts.

- Fixed yet another old bummer that was reaping off assigned
  MIDI controllers on existing track's gain/volume or panning
  controls, when adding any single new track.

- Fixed missing feedback on MIDI controllers assigned to any
  of monitor, record, mute and solo track/bus state buttons. 

- Eye-candy warning: the current clip, not necessarily the
  one currently selected, is now highlighted with a solid
  outline; linked MIDi clips are also highlighted with an
  alternate dashed outline.

- SFZ file conversion, and bundling of the respective sample
  files, is now supported when saving as zip/archive (*.qtz).

- Fixed track monitor, record, mute and solo dangling states,
  on Track/Duplicate command.

- Slight regression on the LV2 State Files abstract/relative
  file-path mapping, trading QFileInfo::canonicalFilePath()
  for QFileInfo::absoluteFilePath(), and thus skipping all
  symlink dereferences in the process.

- Fixed a one first linking/ref-counting glitch, affecting
  recently recorded MIDI clips which might have their initial
  clip length still un-quantized to MIDI resolution (BBT).

- A brand new and discrete MIDI clip editor command tool has
  been added: MIDI Tools/Transpose/Reverse.

- Discretely fixed MIDI Controllers catch-up algorithm.

- Fixed a borderline mistake on plug-in parameter port index
  mapping to its corresponding symbolic name, especially if
  newer plug-in versions are loaded on older saved sessions.


0.7.8  2016-06-23  Snobby Graviton Beta

- MIDI file track names (and any other SMF META events) are
  now converted to and from the base ASCII/Latin-1 encoding,
  as much to prevent invalid SMF whenever non-Latin-1 UTF-8
  encoded MIDI track names are given.

- MIDI file tempo-map and location markers import/export is 
  now hopefully corrected, after almost a decade in mistake,
  regarding MIDI resolution conversion, when different than
  current session's setting (TPQN, ticks-per-quarter-note
  aka. ticks-per-beat, etc.)

- Introducing LV2 UI Show interface support for other types
  than Qt, Gtk, X11 and lv2_external_ui.

- Prevent any visual updates while exporting (freewheeling)
  audio tracks that have at least one plugin activate state
  automation enabled for playback (as much for not showing
  messages like "QObject::connect: Cannot queue arguments
  of type 'QVector<int>'"... anymore).

- The common buses management dialog (View/Buses...) sees
  the superfluous Refresh button finally removed, while two
  new button commands take its place: (move) Up and Down.

- LV2 plug-in Patch support has been added and LV2 plug-ins
  parameter properties manipulation is now accessible on the
  generic plug-in properties dialog.

- Fixed a recently introduced bug, that rendered all but one
  plug-in instance to silence, affecting only DSSI plug-ins
  which implement DSSI_Descriptor::run_multiple_synths() eg.
  fluidsynth-dssi, hexter, etc.


0.7.7  2016-04-27  Haziest Photon Beta

- LV2 UI Touch feature/interface support added.

- MIDI aware plug-ins are now void from multiple or parallel
  instantiation.

- MIDI tracks and buses plug-in chains now honor the number
  of effective audio channels from the assigned audio output
  bus; dedicated audio output ports will keep default to the
  stereo two channels.

- Plug-in rescan option has been added to plug-ins selection 
  dialog (yet another suggestion by Frank Neumann, thanks).

- Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant
  given that's the build default anyway (suggestion by Guido
  Scholz, thanks).

- Immediate visual sync has been added to main and MIDI clip
  editor thumb-views (a request by Frank Neumann, thanks).

- Fixed an old MIDI clip editor contents disapearing bug,
  which manifested when drawing free-hand (ie. Edit/Select
  Mode/Edit Draw is on) over and behind its start/beginning
  position (while in the lower view pane).


0.7.6  2016-04-05  Hazier Photon Beta

- Plug-ins search path and out-of-process (aka. dummy) VST
  plug-in inventory scanning has been heavily refactored.

- Fixed and optimized all dummy processing for plugins with
  more audio inputs and/or outputs than channels on a track
  or bus where it's inserted.
  
- Fixed relative/absolute path mapping when saving/loading
  custom LV2 Plug-in State Presets.


0.7.5  2016-03-21	Hazy Photon Beta

- Beat unit divisor, aka. the denominator or lower numeral
  in the time-signature, have now a visible and practical
  effect over the time-line, even though the standard MIDI
  tempo(BPM) is always denoted in beats as quarter-notes
  (1/4, crotchet, seminima) per minute.

- Fixed an old hack on LV2 State Files abstract/relative
  file-path mapping when saving custom LV2 Presets (after
  a related issue on Fabla2, by Harry Van Haaren, thanks).

- Default PC-Keyboard shortcuts may now be erasable and re-
  assigned (cf. Help/Shortcuts...).

- New option on the audio/MIDI export dialog, on whether to
  add/import the exported result as brand new track(s).

- Introducing brand new track icons property.

- Old Dry/Wet Insert and Aux-send pseudo-plugin parameters
  are now split into separate Dry and Wet controls, what
  else could it possibly be? :)

- Brand new MIDI Insert and Aux-Send pseudo-plugins are now 
  implemented with very similar semantics as the respective
  and existing audio counterparts.

- Implement LV2_STATE__loadDefaultState feature (after pull
  request by Hanspeter Portner aka. ventosus, thanks).

- Plugi-ins search paths internal logic has been refactored;
  an alternative file-name based search is now in effect for
  LADSPA, DSSI and VST plug-ins, whenever not found on their
  original file-path locations saved in a previous session.

- Finally added this brand new menu Clip/Cross Fade command,
  aimed on setting fade-in/out ranges properly, just as far
  to (auto)cross-fade consecutive overlapping clips.

- Fixed all core processing when any plugin has more audio
  outputs than channels on a track/bus where it's inserted.

- Added one decimal digit to all percentage input spin-boxes
  on the MIDI Tools dialog.

- Added brand new and global option to disable the so called
  "catch-up" default behavior (cf. View/Controllers.../Sync).

- Fixed some track control issues related to MIDI Controllers
  generic mapping (cf. View/Controllers...).

- Try making Help/Shortcuts... dialog window modeless, as far
  as under MIDI Controller, Inputs/Outputs Connections window
  also gets accessible enough.

- Fixed some vertical scrolling and play-head line re-drawing
  glitches introduced by the recent unlimited slack to editing
  beyond current contents length on main tracks view.

- Added one decimal digit to the Pitch-shift spin-box on audio
  Clip/Edit... properties dialog window.

- Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.

- Fixed local keyboard shortcuts on the Files organizer widget
  actions and context-menu.

  the beginning of session.


0.7.3  2015-12-29  Tackier Gluon Beta

- Slight increase on the number of decimal digits for the plugin
  parameters while on the generic plugin properties dialog. Also
  applied to automation curve node value editing.

- Unlimited slack is now in effect on editing over and beyond
  the current session or clip contents length, on both the main
  tracks and MIDI clip editor (piano-roll) views.

- Ctrl+click and dragging the left or right edges of a clip will
  now make it spill over and replicate as many clip clones as it
  fits in the left or right horizontal extent.

- Added View/Note Type and Value Type command menus to the MIDI
  clip editor (aka. piano-roll) which opens the possibility for
  discrete shortcuts to switching views eg. Note Velocity and
  Controller views (after a kind request by yubatake, thanks).
  
- Fixed the conversion and/or override of MIDI clip offsets when
  moving and copy/pasting across tempo/time-signature changes.

- Fixed MIDI file track/channel duration estimator, which was
  giving quite wrong and way too short reads.

- Fixed a drag-and-drop bug over the main tracks view, when new 
  tracks were being inserted at the top and not to the bottom as
  is normally indicated by the floating visual placeholder.

- Fixed LV2UI_Resize handle from extension_data(LV2_UI__resize), 
  now passing LV2UI_Handle in first argument to ui_resize(), as
  found correct and needed for resizable/scaleable LV2 UI's, most
  specially to ssj71's so called Infamous Plugins, thanks.


0.7.2  2015-12-10  Tacky Gluon Beta

- Yet another audio/MIDI time drift correction fix, now giving
  it some slack while turnaround looping on tempo changes.

  audio or MIDI metronomes.


0.7.1  2015-10-09  Meson Dope Beta

  program) issue that prevented normal all-shut-up messages from
  being sent to MIDI output buses/ports on playback stop.

- Messages standard output capture has been improved again, now
  in both ways a non-blocking pipe may get.

- Fixed port on MIDI 14-bit controllers input caching.

- Fixed false value readings on the MIDI clip editor (aka. piano
  -roll) tool-tips, when dragging a note velocity or controller
  value outside the acceptable nominal range (eg. 0-127).

  by falktx aka. Filipe Coelho, thanks).

- Fixed wrong initial tempo/time-signature display when session
  is loaded from command line.

- LV2 plug-in UI GTK2 and X11 in Qt5 host native support added.

- Transport/Auto Backward feature now honoring (auto return) to
  same current location precedence as Transport/Backward.

  dialog (Help/Shortcuts...).

- Fixed missing Track and Clip sub-menus from Edit/context-menu
  that were found AWOL ever since after the Lazy Tachyon beta
  release (> 0.6.6).

- An off-by-one bar position (as in BBT, bar, beat and ticks)
  has been purportedly fixed as long as LV2 Time/Position atom
  event transfer goes.

  for the cases where you have multiple plugins with different
  port configurations and a single common UI to drive them all
  (pull request by Hanspeter Portner aka. ventosus, thanks).


0.6.7  2015-05-27  Lepton Acid Beta

  (main left-pane), primarily allowing for group mute/solo
  (and monitor) switching.

- Track-list (left pane) header column widths are now saved
  and made persistent across application power cycle (double
  -click reverts to the old original default).

- Minor fixes on the MIDI clip event list editor, also making
  sure the current event is visible on the piano-roll view.

- As long to prevent asynchronous mistakes to JACK transport
  state changes, an internal slack-delay is now introduced
  after self-initiated transport commands (eg. start/stop).

  View/Options.../MIDI/Playback/Enable MIDI queue time drift
  correction.

- Transport auto-backward feature now honoring last position
  playback was started.

- Introducing brand new application user preferences on
  View/Options.../Display/Options/Custom style and color
  themes (eg. "KXStudio", by Filipe Coelho aka. falkTX).

- Mixer widget gets automatic multi-row strip layout.

- Clip fade-in/out now follows time-stretch resizing, via
  shift/ctrl+click and drag one of its edges.

- Fixed a typo causing FTBFS when VST plug-in support is
  explicity disabled (./configure --disable-vst).


0.6.3  2014-09-22  Armed Hadron Beta

- Make the mouse-wheel to scroll the plugin list views, when
  not hovering a direct-access parameter slider.

- Mixer widget gets (un)dockable Inputs and Outputs panels,
  also with their respective title captions.

- Plugin instantiation is now constrained as much to prevent
  any audio channel output overriding.

- Existing plugin presets may now be selected right(-click)
  from plugin list context-menu (ticket by Harry van Haaren,
  thanks).

- So-called "painting" over multiple selected event values,
  while on the MIDI clip editor view pane below the main
  piano-roll (eg. note velocities, controller values, etc.)
  is now split into two similar painting modes, whether the
  sub-menu Edit/Select Mode/Edit Draw is set on (free-hand)
  or off (linear).

- Drag-and-copy of plug-in instances across tracks or buses
  (ie. cloning) now also copies the direct access parameter
  setting (ticket by Holger Marzen, thanks).

- File/Save As... now prompts and suggests an incremental
  backup name for existing sessions files.

- Zooming in/out increment is now augmented by whether shift
  /ctrl keyboard modifiers are set (on a ticket request by
  Holger Marzen, thanks).

- LV2 Time position event messages for plugin atom ports that
  support it is now being implemented.

- Attempt to break extremely long audio file peak generation
  on session close or program exit (as reported by EternalX,
  thanks again).

- MIDI Controllers Hook and Invert properties are now properly
  saved for tracks (after bug report by Nicola Pandini, thanks).

- A segmentation fault when closing with VST plugins open has
  been hopefully fixed (after a patch by EternalX, thanks).

- Messages standard output capture has been slightly improved
  as for non-blocking i/o, whenever available.

- Automation curve node editing has been slightly improved
  in regard to time positioning and resolution.


0.6.2  2014-07-07  Boson Walk Beta

- Prevent linear and spline automation curve modes for all
  integer valued subjects. Also, make sure those values are
  rounded to the nearest integer away from zero.

- Fixed save of LV2 Presets for plugins with state files.

- A man page has beed added (making up Gürkan Sengün's work
  on debian, thanks).

- When moving plugins by eg. drag-and-dropping across tracks,
  automation curves were being left behind, maybe leading to
  unpredictable mistaken behavior. Hopefully, not anymore.

- Translations install directory change.

- Automation curves are now automatically re-adjusted to tempo
  map node changes (after a ticket by Holger Marzen, thanks).

- Audio/MIDI files or plugins found missing on session load
  are now subject for an explicit modal warning message and
  prompt for an immediate session backup salvage.

- Changing instrument plugin programs is now an undo/redo-able
  command operation, especially for DSSI but also for plugins
  that come with the LV2 Programs interface extension support
  (http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/ns/lv2ext/programs).

- Drawing, selecting and/or resizing of MIDI note events that
  extend across tempo/time-signature changes is now made a bit
  more correctly over the MIDI clip editor (aka. piano-roll),
  especially regarding to current snap-to-beat setting (after
  an outstanding ticket by yubatake, thanks).

- Once again, audio frame/MIDI time drift correction has been
  slightly refactored to improve MIDI input monitor and timing.

- Discrete automation curve node values may now be edited via
  a numerical entry floating spin-box on double-click (as yet
  another request by AutoStatic aka. Jeremy Jongepier, thanks).

- Pressing shift/ctrl keyboard modifiers while double-clicking
  on a plugin list entry now briefly reverses the current View
  /Options.../Plugins/Editor/Open plugin's editor (GUI) by
  default option preference.

- Fixed an old crash lurker when switching output buses that
  implied a change on the number of audio channels, while on
  tracks that have (auto-)monitor turned on and at least one
  active plugin in chain (yet another ticket by AutoStatic
  aka. Jeremy Jongepier, thanks).

- MIDI Controller assignment (aka MIDI learn) and/or automation
  of plugins (de)activation state has been added (as requested
  by AutoStatic aka. Jeremy Jongepier, thanks).

- LV2 UI Idle and Show interfaces support added.

- Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS
  (patch by Alessio Treglia aka. quadrispro, thanks).


O.6.1  2014-04-29  Bitsy Sweet Beta

- New user preference option added as View/Options.../Display
  /Transport/Hold auto-scrolling (follow play-head) on edits
  (after requests by Holger Marzen and Louigi Verona, thanks).

- All color chooser dialogs were missing proper titles.

- Audio peak file re-generation and clean-up has been hopefully
  fixed and cache optimized (re. drawing audio clip waveforms).

- Fixed initial session snap-per-beat setting on main toolbar.

- Clip/Export...'ed files are now made persistent, no questions
  asked (after a ticket by Oliver Kester, thanks).

- Portuguese (pt) translation added (by Esteban Viveros, thanks).


0.6.0  2014-03-21  Byte Bald Beta

- New user option added: on whether to save plugins automation
  values with higher resolution as possible, using 14-bit NRPN:
  cf. View/Options.../Plugins/Experimental/High resolution
  plugin automation (default=off).

- Generic native plugin dialogs now shows an additional "About"
  last page where authorship credits are due.

- A new user preference option is now in place for whether to
  use desktop environment's own native file requester/browser
  dialogs (View/Options.../Display/Dialogs/Use native dialogs).

- A bit of slack have been introduced to put "Follow Playhead"
  (aka. auto-scroll view mode) on hold, while doing in-flight
  selection edit moves.

- Fixed some user interface related annoyances while on the MIDI
  Controllers mappings (ie. View/Controllers...).

- Fixed port origin on MIDI RPN/NRPN 14-bit controllers input.

- A discretionary plug-in unique identifier have been devised for
  when more than one from the same type are inserted on a bus or
  track chain, avoiding destructive clashing of automation data.

- Horizontal scrolling shift+mouse-wheel direction now reversed.

- LV2 Dyn(amic)-manifest support is now optional (default=off);
  cf. View/Options.../Plugins/Experimental/LV2 Dynamic Manifest
  support).

- The following options, although decieved on View/Options... as
  global configuration options, were always and still are proper
  session instance properties: (JACK) Transport mode, MMC mode,
  MMC device, MIDI SPP and MIDI Clock modes, are now shown there
  reflecting the current open session state.

- A couple of run-time circumventions have been hacked in, both
  strictly related to when NSM session management is in charge:
  1) the new session template feature is disabled (was aborting
  initial NSM new client additions); 2) the native (as from the
  desktop environment eg. KDE) file browser/requester dialogs are
  disabled (were taking too long to list the current directory on
  first time invocation).

- Update current automation/curve nodes selection while changing
  horizontal (time axis) zoom levels.

- One liner's attempt to make it consistent behaviour on resizing
  and moving multiple selected notes or events while on the MIDI
  clip editor (aka. piano-roll; after a ticket request from Daniel
  MacDonald aka. danboid, thanks).

- Introducing tiny quarter-note/crotchet/seminima/beat icon on all
  snap-to-beat selection items get a new icon :).

- Corrected some audio buffering boundary conditions that were
  causing dead-loops/freezes while merging some audio clips.

- Session auto-save period was chronically reduced to one third 
  of its user setting; non critical but fixed now.


0.5.12  2013-12-31  Mike November

- Fixed another off-by-one MIDI plugin chain timing bug, delaying
  the actual playback of the first MIDI event, whenever it started
  at the same and as long as the initial play-head position (after
  another ticket by Holger Marzen, thanks again).

- A new LV2 host convention is in effect on plugins that expose
  multiple AtomPort's in either direction: only the first input
  or output declared AtomPort is eligible to convey regular MIDI
  data events (introduced while trying Frank Kober's forthcoming
  QmidiArp LV2 suite of plugins, thanks).

- Zooming with shift/ctrl+mouse-wheel and pointing over the main
  tracks view or MIDI clip editor time ruler header's now fixed.

- A rare freezing loop condition has been fixed on the oldest of
  MIDI file save/write routines (after a ticket and solution by
  Tuomas Airaksinen, thanks again).

- Copy/paste now preserving clip names (ticket by Holger Marzen,
  thanks).

- Scaling of whole tempo map with a given factor has been added,
  through a spin-box and button in Tempo Map / Markers dialog,
  after a long overdue patch by Tuomas Airaksinen, thanks again.

- When issued from main tracks view (ie. Clip/Tools menu) MIDI
  clip tools are now a bit more crash-resilient re. undo/redo-
  ability.

- Session auto-save / crash-recovery support is now on trial as
  in View/Options.../General/Session/Auto-save current working
  session every 10 minutes (default on).

- Plugin-list chain context-menu now includes MIDI instrument
  audio output options to existing non-dedicated output buses,
  any other than the previous hard-wired default (eg. Master).

- Tracks export now allows for the mix-down/merge of multiple
  audio/MIDI output buses (Track/Export Tracks).

- When adding new tracks, try preserving the last selected bus
  names, while not the default Master ones (after a suggestion 
  from danboid aka. Daniel MacDonald, thanks).

- More preparations for Qt5 configure build.

- Brand new thumb-(over)view toolbar widget added to MIDI clip
  editor window (aka. piano-roll overview).

- General MIDI RPN/NRPN 14-bit controller support is now being
  introduced on real-time MIDI input parsing, on standard MIDI
  file I/O, on MIDI Controller options and, of course, on MIDI
  clip and event list editor.

- Pretty innocent nitpick on most thread cleanup routines.


0.5.11  2013-10-07  Lima Oscar

- Adding a track now inserts it after the current one, if any;
  one can also drag and move a track below the last one in the
  track list (main view left pane).

- Extended Edit/Select Mode/Automation: multi-selection mode,
  cut, copy, paste and delete of current track's automation
  curve nodes, now reached implementation ready status.

- Another old silent bug bites the dust: changing track names
  were dropping any track gain/volume and panning automation
  curves when saving the session.

- A primeval processing bug has been sorted out: aux-sends to
  audio output buses that just appear to be after the input
  bus where they're inserted were being left muted and silent
  (on a ticket follow-up by Holger Marzen, thanks).

- Fixed a sure crash bug exposed when processing of aux-send
  plugins when inserted too early on audio input buses chain
  (after a ticket report by Holger Marzen, thanks).

- Allow the build system to include an user specified CFLAGS 
  (patch by Cristian Morales Vega, thanks).

- Shift/Ctrl keyboard modifiers now set to extend current clip
  selection while in main track view's Edit/Select Mode/Range,
  Rectangle modes.

- Main Edit/Select Mode/Automation icon retouched to look a bit
  more obvious and intuitive, hopefully ;)

- Allow to change the velocities/values of the current selected
  events which have the exact same onset times and hide beyhond
  each other on the MIDI clip editor's pane below the main view
  piano-roll (ie. the one that represents MIDI event values as a
  bar chart).

- Fixed some problematic playback/export muting and annoying
  cleanup freezing, due on audio tracks with too many clips
  eg. more than hundred clip splits (hopefully fixes an issue
  reported by Louigi Verona, thanks).

- LV2 UI resize feature support/control added.

- Fixed dedicated MIDI control and MIDI metronome port connection
  restore conflict (thanks to jhammen catch & patch:).

- New user preference option added: reverse middle-button role to
  Shift/Ctrl keyboard state, in special regard to edit-head/tail
  vs. play-head positioning while on the main track and MIDI clip
  editor (aka. piano-roll) views.


0.5.10  2013-07-18  Kilo Papa

- Default drum-key note names are now properly showing on MIDI
  tracks that are assigned to known drum/percussive instrument
  patches (eg. SoundFont 2 (.sf2) bank 128).

- Time display format (frames, clock-time or BBT) may now be
  changed from the context-menu on any time entry spin-box.

- LV2 plugin support is now tightly tied to liblilv; the same tie
  applies to LV2 plugin UI support and libsuil and vice-versa.

- Mixer buses racks (ie. left/input and right/output panes) are
  now both kept fixed-width when whole mixer window is resized.

- Unconditional LV2 Dyn(amic)-manifest support has been added.

- Main track-view Edit/Insert, Remove/Range dialog is now being
  introduced with optional applicability to Clips, Loop, Punch
  in/out, Automation, Tempo-map and/or Markers.

- New range removal editing tool, split/moving clips backward
  at the specified edit-head/tail interval (Edit/Remove/Range,
  Track Range)--by Tuomas Airaksinen, thanks.

- Andy Fitzsimon's original icon from opencliparts.org makes
  it through as the default standard scalable format (SVG).

- Automation's back in effect on Track/Export Tracks.../Audio.

- Reversed Shift/Ctrl keyboard modifier roles on middle-button
  clicking over the main track and MIDI clip editor views (aka.
  piano-roll) in regression to original old semantics.

- Color selection actions now have a brand new palette icon.

- Make sure main track-view and MIDI clip editor selection is
  only cleared on specific discrete commands.

- Try keeping the original session file in most recent files
  menu list, despite current version auto-incremental backup
  mode is in effect.

- Fixed non-zero clip offsets upon tempo/time-scale changes.

- Some sympathy to extreme dark color (read black) schemes is
  now indulged on empty backgrounds.


0.5.9  2013-06-06  Juliet Quebec

- Auto-incremental version numbering of backup session files;
  brand new versioning mode option added.

- Fixed one long as ever MIDI file export bug, which was about
  washing all self-induced MIDI bank-select (CC#0, CC#32) and
  program-change (PC#) events into MIDI channel 1, regardless
  of the source track/channel.

- Fixed initial sample-rate settlement on plugin chains for all
  tracks and buses whenever a session file original sample-rate
  differs from the current audio device engine (ie. JACK).

- New German (de) translation added (by Guido Scholz, thanks).

- Now accepting JACK transport tempo and time-tignature changes
  while in slave transport mode.

- Fix ref-count and auto-removal of created files that result
  from clip merge/export when session is closed but not saved.

- MIDI track instrument bank/program selection, from plugin UIs
  that support it, is now effectively and complete.

- Custom connections for dedicated audio outputs from all plugin
  chains in MIDI tracks or buses are back in business, hopefuly
  restored gain on session load (ticket by yuba, thanks).

- Track Properties dialog now dirty after any plugin related
  change (another head-up by yuba, thanks again).

- Tempo Map/Markers dialog is not set initially dirty anymore.

- Audio buses plugin state's persistance were found AWOL: while
  being properly saved as usual, were being restored to default
  on every session reload (as noticed by yuba, thanks).

- NSM (Non Session Management) support is being introduced.

- The MIDI clip editor (aka. piano-roll) gets a brand new rescale
  mode: ctrl+dragging the right edge of a note now rescales all
  times and duration of all the subsequent selected notes (after
  an interesting idea/ticket by Joel Leclerc, thanks).

- The new MIDI clip editor rescale mode also applicable to event
  values (eg. note velocities, pitch-bend), while ctrl+dragging
  the edges of an event vertical bar.

- VST plugin (GUI) idle timer makes a comeback.

- Hard-wired LV2 UI selection order for plugins which supply more
  than one option (lv2_external_ui gets always honored first then,
  as provided via libsuil, X11, GTK and last but not least, Qt4).


0.5.8  2013-03-19  India Romeo

- Dropped old audio ramping spin-locks as its glitching reduction
  weren't that effective anymore.

- Audio bus and track gain may now be set for amplification again,
  from +0dB up to +6dB, while using the Mixer strip sliders/faders
  (an old function found missing ever since pre-TYOQA).

- Basic LV2 X11 UI support has been added through libSUIL but only
  really effective if plugins doesn't support the LV2 External UI
  extension in addition which takes precedence on any case.

- Improved precision tolerance on the Tempo Map / Markers dialog.

- Reinstated and fixed (old) warning and impending re-conversion on
  loading session files which the original sample-rate differs from
  current audio device engine (aka. JACK).

- LV2 Plugin State/Preset name discrimination fix (after a ticket
  by Jiri Prochaszka aka. Anchakor, thanks:)

- Linked/ref-counted audio clips must not overlap and now must have
  a buffer-size worth of a gap between each other.

- Something fishy has been detected in the SSE (not so) optimized
  code from SoundTouch's-inspired WSOLA time-stretching.

- Splitting clips apart is now easier than ever: a brand new entry
  enters the main menu scene: Edit/Split (Ctrl+Y) splits up clips
  according to current range/rectangular selection.

- Audio clip offsets are now properly corrected when time-stretching
  is applied via Shift/Ctrl+dragging any of the clip edges.

- One semi-colon typo was hiding proper descrimination of peak files
  used to draw distinct waveforms of time-stretched audio clips.

- Track automation curves are now also affected by Edit/Insert/Range
  commands.

- Finally, some visual feedback is shown while audio track export
  is running, in he form of a main status progress bar. 

- New user option: save backup versions of existing session files.

- Default session directory now set to regular file's path on load.

- A convenient minimum slack duration has been fixed for MIDI SysEx
  messages.

- LV2 Time/position information is now asynchronously fed back into
  their parameter (control input) ports when designated.

- LV2 State is now properly restored for  plugins inserted on buses,
  probably solving the Calf Fluidsynth SoundFont information missing
  on buses ticket, reported by Albert Graef, thanks.

- Fixed an immediate null pointer crash on creating a parentless new
  group while on the files organizer widget.

- Preparations for future Qt5 migration.


0.5.7  2012-12-27  Hotel Sierra

- Loop and punch in/out ranges may now get set simultaneously, may
  even overlap each other. However, punch in/out range recording
  will always prevail over any loop recording takes.

- LV2 Worker/Schedule now supporting multi-instance vs. single-UI
  scenarios.

- LV2 Options and Buf-size extension support added.

- Fixed an off-by-one-tick bug on MIDI file input which was leaving
  spurious zero-length runt notes at the end of a MIDI clip, if a
  note-on coincides with the ending/split point (on ticket issued
  by Jonathan H. Pickard, thanks).

- Good old SLV2 library support for LV2 plug-ins (libslv2) is now
  irrevocably deprecated, or better said, completely wiped-out from
  the LV2 host code, now considered extinct.

- LV2 UI parameter updates are now asynchronously detached from the
  source GUI widget thread, in attempt to improve cross-GUI-toolkit
  responsiveness, specially focused on LV2 plugins with a GTK based
  UI (eg. amsynth, triceratops, etc.).

- Make sure LV2 UI parameters (input control ports) get updated when
  loading a genuine LV2 state preset.

- Improved the (custom) tempo spin-box widget signal(ing) processing
  and dispatching.

- Show proper pointing cursor and location tool-tip while dragging any
  of the time ruler markers (including latest location markers/bar).

- On saving as an archive/zip session file (suffix .qtz) include only
  those files that are actually referenced by live clips arrangement.

- Ongoing integration of location markers infrastructure (time-scale
  and MIDI-file support).

- Free-hand/linear retouching of event values, while on the MIDI clip
  editor's view pane below the main piano-roll (eg. note velocities),
  is now possible provided the target events are selected, otherwise
  the usual painting edit sub-mode applies (cf. menu Edit/Select Mode/
  Edit Draw).

- The MIDI clip editor now senses which target view pane has focus for
  general selection commands (cf. Edit/Select/None, All, Invert, Range)
  whether the main piano-roll or the event value (velocities) view.

- Mouse middle-button clicking is back in business on main track-view
  and on MIDI clip editor views (piano-roll) as an immediate play-head
  (re)positioning command or merge/reset the edit-head/tail cursors if
  Shift/Ctrl keyboard modifiers are pressed.

- Formerly protected, class qtractorClip::FadeFunctor is now public
  in an shot-in-the-dark attempt to fix clang builds (as reported by
  Jekyll Wu, thanks).

- Override all sub-classed widgets mouse-pointer event handlers to be
  isolated from base widget style and/or window management.


0.5.6  2012-10-02  Golf Tango

- Day 1 post-release fix: LV2 plugins with a GTK GUI were not shown
  due to their respective widget (GdkWidget) being prematurely and
  unexpectedly destroyed when raised (via libsuil).

- The dedicated audio outputs setting for instrument plugins was not
  in effect as default global option for new MIDI tracks, now fixed,
  hopefully (thanks to danboid aka. Daniel MacDonald persistence).

- An immediate Files widget cleanup option is now made available, as
  to select and remove all unused file entries.

- MIDI track (un)solo/mute reset clip event sequence fixing; definite
  regression to MIDI track's occasional muting bug while clip editing
  and playback is rolling.

- Apologies due on this one: Shift/Ctrl keyboard modifiers are back
  in business to change MIDI events currently selected in one single
  step while on MIDI clip editor (aka. piano-roll). Sorry.

- Japanese (ja) translation added (by Takashi Sakamoto).

- General time-scale bar, beat and tempo rounding fixing.

- Keyboard shortcuts configuration (Help/Shortcuts...) now checks and
  warns for already assigned key sequences.

- The View/Snap menu is now listed as fully accessible actions, making
  each snap-per-beat setting assignable to a keyboard shortcut (after
  a feature request by danboid aka. Daniel MacDonald, thanks).

- Fixed MIDI resize tool, now applying symmetric proportional changes
  to pitch-bend event values [-8191, +8191].

- Fixed re-loading of LV2 Presets that are newly created/saved during
  current session; actually delete and remove a LV2 Preset if found
  in the file-system (as suggested by Jiri Prochaszka aka. Anchakor,
  thanks again).

- Preset drop-down list is now sorted, on plugin properties dialog.

- After a long absence, edit(blue) cursor vertical lines are back on
  the MIDI clip editor views (aka. piano-roll).

- LV2 1.0.0 compliance phase II: LV2 State Files support completed.

- Updated to newer LV2 External UI extension support (now maintained
  by Filipe Coelho aka. falktx).

- Brand new editing tool: empty range insertion, split/moving clips
  or events forward the specified edit-head/tail interval, defaults
  to next measure or bar (cf. menu Edit/Insert/Range, Track Range).

- Don't show the waiting cursor anymore when loading any plugins which
  might have a nice native editor (GUI) and options are set to show it.

- MIDI clip editor now hopefully rid of random but persistent muting,
  a slight regression to editing while playback is rolling.

- A MIDI file player's bug, evident while transport rolling in looped
  mode, has been fixed with yet another oneliner patch (kind by Jiri
  Prochaszka aka. Anchakor, thanks again).

- LV2 plugins with a Qt4 GUI (guess what or whom?) are now guaranteed
  to some reasonable window type like Qt::Widget but not Qt::Dialog
  nor Qt::Popup, preventing those from standing always on top while
  on some window managers or desktop environments (a simple addition
  by Jiri Prochaszka aka. Anchakor, thanks).

- MIME type icons support for session (*.qtr *.qtr), template (*.qtt)
  and zip/archive (*.qtz) are now being introduced.

- LV2 State Files feature support is shamelessly getting real trial,
  now letting files referenced in LV2 plugin states to be seamlessly
  included when saving to a zip/archive file bundle (.qtz suffix).

- Added some virtual destructor stubs to shut up gcc 4.7 warnings.

- Improved plugin state resilience, now finally with parameter name
  matching, specifically targeted on loading old sessions or plugin
  preset files (.qtx), preserving old saved plugin states as much as
  possible in face of rogue or discrete parameter index renumbering,
  due naturally on any plugin's life cycle ie. upgrades etc.;)

- Added some more snap-to-beat divisors (Beat/14, /21 and /28) due on
  feature request ticket, while dropping highest, probably useless one
  (Beat/128).

- New French (fr) translation added (by Yann Collette, thanks).

- Slight late optimization on vertical zebra/grid lines drawing. 


0.5.5  2012-06-15  Foxtrot Uniform

- Auto-monitored MIDI tracks were missing their pass-through to their
  respective MIDI output bus plugin chains, now fixed and letting any
  multi-timbral instrument plugin to get a peek from auto-monitoring.

- New user option/preference to whether to open a plugin's editor (GUI)
  by default, when available (cf. View/Options.../Plugins/Editor).

- Clicking and/or dragging for rubber-band selection on main track-view
  canvas doesn't change the edit-head and -tail positions anymore.

- Backward and Forward transport commands now have an additional stop
  at first clip start point.

- LV2 Atom/MIDI buffering support is finally entering the scene; LV2
  Worker/Schedule support is also included in a bold attempt to convey
  non-MIDI event transfers between plugin and its UI.

- MIDI Clip editor (aka. piano-roll) and MIDI Tools fix: avoid note-on
  events of zero velocity, which conventionally equates to a dangling
  note-off event and dropped into oblivion sooner or later. There's no
  more need for Shift/Ctrl keyboard modifier to change in one single
  step all the MIDI events that are currently selected (now consistent
  with drag-move).

- LV2 Presets support now entering effective operational status; a new
  local option has been added (cf. View/Options.../Plugins/Paths/LV2
  Presets directory; default is ~/.lv2).

- Dropped XInitThreads() head call as it was never useful but on those
  early days of JUCE VST plugins.

- Italian (it) translation added (by Massimo Callegari, thanks).

- Clip fade-in/out dragging now follows snap-to-beat setting.

- Late modern eye-candy indulgence: alternate shaded stripes, on every
  other bar as in a "zebra" background option for the main tracks and
  MIDI clip editor views (cf. View/Snap/Zebra).

- LV2 Time/position information is now being supported through special
  designated plugin input ports (after suggestion by Filipe Coelho aka.
  falktx). Additionally, the time/position information report has been
  corrected and complemented for VST plugins.

- Audio vs. MIDI time drift correction has been slightly improved
  against rogue tempo changes across looping cycles.

- Honor tempo/timing on MIDI instrument plugins. Happy regression fix
  on getting MIDI note-offs at looping ends back in business; all the
  necessary bumming for MIDI plugins to play nice in face of tempo
  changes and whenever playback is started from anywhere but the
  beginning of the time-line (ie. frame zero); thanks to rvega aka.
  Rafael Vega, for the heads-up).

- Audio clip wave-forms were being displayed in inverted phase (ie.
  upside-down) all this time ever since day one. What a shame! :)

- LV2 Programs interface is getting initial experimental status, to
  let LV2 instrument plugins get on par with the DSSI and VST crowd
  for MIDI bank/program instrument inventory and selection support
  (a sidetrack complot with Filipe Coelho aka. falktx, thanks:).

- Dropped the old but entirely useless LV2 URI-unmap feature, now
  being superseded by official LV2 URID (un)mapper.

- Russian (ru) translation added (by Alexandre Prokoudine, thanks).

- SLV2 deprecation process started, effective now at configure time.

- Added include <unistd.h> to shut up gcc 4.7 build failures (patch
  by Alessio Treglia).

- Another approach avoiding recursive observer widget updates. Also
  applies to mixer, monitor and track state buttons.

- Update to latest LV2 state extension (by David Robillard, thanks).

- Loop-recording/take number displayed on clip title, respectively.

- Make(ing) -jN parallel builds now available for the masses.

- A one buffer period slack on audio engine's loop turn-around logic
  might just have fixed an illusive report on loop-recording/takes
  going progressively out-of-sync, most notably when recording under
  large audio buffer period sizes (>= 1024 frames/buffer).

- Editing MIDI while playback is rolling, doesn't mute the track any
  more, adding a point to the live editing experience.

- Finer granularity for direct access parameter mouse wheel changes.

- Dropped a dumb optimization for short full-cached multiple linked
  /ref-counted audio clips which were incidentally out-of-sync after
  rewind/backward playback. Once again and uncertain to be the last
  take on this, got fixed (probably related to some oddity reported
  by Louigi Verona, thanks).


0.5.4  2012-03-01  Echo Victor

- Direct access plugin/insert parameter changing tool-tip added.

- A Transport/Panic action enters the scene, in a nostalgic attempt
  to emulate the all-MIDI-track-shut-off command of those drop-dead
  and primordial MIDI sequencers of all time. Now finally a keyboard
  shortcut and mouse click-away ;)

- MIDI editor command redo/undo adjustment now effective on all other
  channel events besides notes, which overlap at the same event time.

- A new File/Unlink menu action is now made available from the MIDI
  clip editor (aka. piano-roll) for detaching the current linked/ref-
  counted MIDI clip into a new auto-incremented SMF filename.

- Some audio/MIDI content/media-file resource management is entering
  the scene, taking care of some file-system house-keeping, this gets
  evident on unsaved/dead recorded files being automaticaly removed
  from the file-system, on session close.

- Killed the old and entirely deprecated LV2 Save/Restore and Persist
  feature/extensions support.

- Auto-monitored MIDI events are now merged/queued correctly into the
  instrument plugin playback queue, avoiding sudden crashes, hopefully.

- Awesome patch from Albert Graef, thanks, which makes most MIDI SysEx  
  to get through MIDI instrument plugins at last; applies to DSSI and
  LV2 plugins only.

- LV2 URID map/unmap feature support added.

- Plugin parameter value redo/undo command aliasing fix.

- Double-clicking in plugin list item now show/activates the plugin's
  editor window (was toggling visibility/activation).

- Plugin path settings have been fixed again, with special regards to
  an effective LV2_PATH environment variable settlement.

- Session properties dialog now asks to create a new session directory
  if the given one does not currently exist.

- MIDI note names and their respective octave numbers are now compliant
  with the ISO standard where middle C (60) is now C4 (was C3).

- Fixed audible glitch/pop at the beginning of an audio clip with long
  quadratic or cubic shaped fade-in (reported by Lougi Verona, thanks).

- MIDI Controller Auto-Hook patch by Alessandro Preziosi, thanks.

- Make sure all MIDI note-off are always queued after their respective
  note-on events when buffering for MIDI input of instrument plugins,
  event though for zero duration MIDI note events (hopefully fixing
  the hanging notes bug reported by Albert Graef, thanks).

- LV2 MIDI-fx plugin support has been repaired.

- Single-track clip selection logic corrected again, fixing multi-clip
  selection drag/move across an odd number of distinct tracks (after a
  bug report by Louigi Verona, on linux-audio-dev, thanks).

- MMC Locate time-code hour bit-field fix; MMC Locate now also on loop
  turnarounds (patches by Albert Graef, thanks).

- Looping across multiple linked/ref-counted audio clips was incredibly
  broken with complete out-of-sync playback. Hopefully fixed now, with
  auto-unlinking/cloning all the affected audio clip buffers.

- Audio clip overlapping detection off-by-one(-frame) fix.

- MIDI Tools/Resize value ramp mode has been added (mocking the 'resize
  to range' feature request by Daniel MacDonald aka. danboid).


0.5.3  2011-12-28  Delta Whisky

- Fixed initial LV2 plugin UI widget/window titles.

- Attempt to get any brand new LV2 plugins Qt4 enabled UI's working on
  either slv2 and lilv build modes ;) (nailed by falkTX, thanks).

- Current clip is ultimately inferred from the one under the play-head
  position and current selected track; the last one clicked over and/or
  selected still has precedence (following request by Loiugi Verona).

- Drag-moving clips horizontally with the keyboard arrow-keys just got
  a step better with a fixed minimum of one pixel, depending still on
  the current snap-per-beat setting and horizontal zoom level (as
  suggested by Louigi Verona, thanks).

- Get maximum and minimum peak values back when drawing audio waveforms.

- Automation play/feedback has been missed to show on those plugins
  that provide their own GUI, now on par with all the rest 'homebrew'
  widgets (eg. generic plugin properties dialog).

- All plugin parameters automation and selection were left inaccessible
  until the generic native plugin dialog is eventually shown, now fixed.


0.5.2  2011-12-16  Charlie X-ray

- Fixed a probably old lurking destructive bug, which was incidental to
  when an invalid or non audio file is imported, intentionally or by
  mistake, into new or existing audio clips (eg. importing a MIDI file
  where an audio file is expected).

- Force audio file closing to occur on the very same disk-write (sync)
  thread, possibly mitigating an old random crash issue lurking in the
  vorbis reference encoder (recording) re. the non thread-safeness of
  the vorbis_analysis() final call.

- Fixed extraordinary shadow-playback of audio clips which extent were
  longer than the respective audio file length.

- Default session file format option now promoted (see View/Options...
  /General/Session) in the way of whether file suffix gets honored upon
  session open or save (.qtr, .qts or .qtz). This brand new option also
  applies for default state file format on a JACK-session salvage
  context.

- The View/Options... (aka. user preferences) dialog sees a new
  arranjement in layout, with some options moving into this brand
  new tab page called General.

- LV2 State extension support has been added, which shall replace old
  LV2 Persist extension interface in the near future. It also replaces
  the LV2 Files extension from now on (thanks to Dave Robillard).

- Dirty MIDI clips are now auto-saved when MIDI track properties get
  changed through its own dialog.

- Fixed one probable too old crash when canceling a new/add track dialog.

- MIDI SysEx event list editing is now fixed.

- Once again, make sure all recorded clips start and end at the very
  same position when multiple track recording is turned on/off, while
  playback is still rolling.

- Fixed Makefile.in handling installation directories to the configure
  script eg. --datadir, --localedir.

- Possible attempt to improve in-flight recording clip display,
  especially when looping and MIDI clips are involved.

- MIDI clip revision (re)numbering paranoia has been improved as much to
  avoid MIDI file clashes as much as possible while editing multiple MIDI
  clips which reference the same SMF and track/channel.

- Creating new or updating existing buses with exact same names of any
  current dedicated inputs/outputs (which are implemented as special
  covert buses) is now disallowed.

- Loop-recording/takes functionality is now ready for the masses and
  accessible from brand new Clip/Take menu (Select, First, Previous, Next,
  Last, Reset and Range...; the latter is actually being provided as bonus
  feature :) as to fold any given clip into so-called takes, simulating
  loop-recording mode over an arbitrary range).

- Loop-recording/takes infrastructure integration is sneaking in: all
  clips recorded under a loop/cycle range may now get split (folded) into
  one or more so-called takes. A new option is now provided, as to select
  which take is about to retain after the recording ends, either the First
  or the Last one. Just turn this mode off (None) and keep with the old
  recording behavior, where clips are laid out unfolded through the
  timeline, as usual (see menu View/Options.../Display/Loop recording
  mode).

- Improved robustness in face of disabled audio buses when global maximum
  number of JACK (audio) ports is surpassed.

- Improved single-track clip selection status logic.

- Clip/Unlink action is now available for detaching linked/ref-counted
  MIDI clips, renaming and saving into auto-incremental SMF filenames.

- Temporary session archive directory now (pre)fixed with program name
  (eg. /tmp/qtractor).

- Fixed VST GUI editor window title on first show.

- Fixed build for ancient VST-SDK 2.3 (32bit only).


0.5.1  2011-10-05  Bravo Yankee

- More LADISH support: SIGTERM signal is nowrapped for graceful
  application close.

- Improved paste-repeat snap precision when dealing with large repeat
  counts.

- Czech (cs) translation added, by Pavel Fric.

- Added a few snap-to-beat divisors (unusual Beat/5, Beat/7, Beat/9 and
  Beat/10) for completeness sake.

- Such a simple change of mind with a visual twist: the "A" track
  automation button/menu has now been moved to the right-most, as it
  belongs ;)

- Auto-connection of dedicated audio outputs is now optional for default
  audio master bus, metronome, player and MIDI instrument plugin dedicated
  audio outputs.

- Finally, after a pitiful large brain-dead period, generic plugin forms
  are now showing all possible controllable plugin parameters featuring a
  paged, tabbed dialog, whenever applicable.

- Special hack/fix for JUCE based native VST plugins, which are the most
  actually found with a GUI editor, skipping explicit shared library
  unloading and thus avoiding some mysterious crashes on session close
  and/or application exit.

- Support for MIDI-fx plugins (native VST and/or LV2) is now implemented
  and functional (intra-chain only).Instrument plugin bank/program
  selection  was found broken or dead in the water, specially on VSTi, now
  finally  fixed again.

- VST plugin parameter value display on generic form is now back in
  business (were dead regarding value changes).

- All plugin's provided GUI editors are now honored by being popped up
  first, instead of the usual but good old generic plugin form.

- Long overdue implementation of a dedicated MIDI file player is now
  accessible from the MIDI files widget; one can play the whole SMF or
  just a single track or channel.

- Update to a newer VeSTige header, probably fixing an old 32 vs. 64 bit
  mismatch.

- Avoid JACK session filenames/paths to be ever shown; also avoid all
  buses ports (re)connections when JACK sessions are (re)loaded, given the
  fact that session management will take care of just that; more also,
  untitled/default session names are now also picked up to match current
  LADISH project name, obviously given by LADISH_PROJECT_NAME environment
  variable, whenever present (as suggested by Nedko Ardaunov).

- Paste-repeat floating selection has been fixed (was showing only the
  last repeated selection).

- Coherence of tempo changes on audio and MIDI clips, whether automatic
  time-stretching is in effect, has been slightly improved, hopefully
  fixed.

- Bold attempt to get linked (aka. ref-counted) audio and MIDI clips into
  practice.

- Main track view now showing all clips above the grid.

- Added support for both new and older (deprecated uri) lv2_external_ui
  extension (by Nedko Ardaunov).

- Following yet another great idea, and implementation, by Holger
  Dehnhardt, who already brought us the new aux-send insert plugin, thanks
  again, the so-called direct access control option is now featured for
  any plugin parameter right from plugin listings eg. mixer strips.

- General resource consumption and management has been slightly improved,
  due to internal buses allocation optimization.

- Fixed nasty crash-bug that was severely affecting all sessions that had
  at least one insert (pseudo-)plugin on any audio input bus.

- All automation curve nodes are now relocated whenever disparate session
  sample-rate is detected on load.

- New aux-send/insert pseudo-plugin is now introduced, allowing to route
  any track audio output to any other audio output bus besides the nominal
  one -- thanks to an original implementation from Holger Dehnhardt.

- New immediate edit/loop-range settings from current clip extents,
  accessible on the main menu (Clip/Range Set, Loop Set) and from MIDI
  clip editor menu as well (File/Range Set, Loop Set).

- MIDI Names XML files (*.midnam) may now be imported into MIDI instrument
  definitions.

- Avoid cursor reset while editing MIDI events list (fixes bug reported by
  Frank Neumann).

- Just some typos fixing (patch by c-korn).

- Track view automation curve editing mode has been slightly fixed, now
  allowing for other previously existing point-and-click mouse operations.

- Default automation curve mode is now preserved (following a suggestion
  by Alexandre Prokoudine, thanks).


0.5.0  2011-07-22  Alpha Zulu (TYOQA)

- MIDI controller learn/catch-up sees the way in: MIDI controller changes
  are now only effective after catching-up with their respective program
  parameters, avoiding abrupt jumps and keeping a safe and continuous
  behavior.

- Track/Height menu is now featured, giving access to Increase, Decrease
  or Reset the current track height.

- All changes to audio gain and panning on tracks and buses are now
  applied following a piece-wise linear ramp, reducing the old nasty
  clicks, pops or zipper artifacts that might be awfully audible on some
  situations, most specially on automation.

- All zooming in/out is now relative to either the viewport center or
  current mouse cursor position if found laying inside.

- TYOQA! the underground sources have emerged:... after years in the
  making, track automation, or dynamic curves as some like to call, is
  finally a reality, tricky but real ;)

- Audio clip anti-glitch/ramp-smoothing effect is now slightly independent
  of current buffer-size period.

- Once buried under the Edit menu, Clip menu has been finally promoted to
  top main menu.

- Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working threads.

- Fixed muted loop playback on audio clips ending coincidentally with the
  loop-turn/end point.

- Old/deprecated JACK port latency support added to audio recording
  latency compensation.

- Audio clip merge/export lock-ups now untangled.

- LV2 extension headers update.

- Fixed configure of newer LV2 host implementation stack (LILV) when older
  (SLV2) is not present.


0.4.9  2011-05-26  The Final Dudette

- Session file format saved on JACK session has been reverted to
  archive/zip bundle one (.qtz) now using temporary extraction directory
  when loading an existing JACK session.

- Main toolbar time and tempo widgets get their visual extents a bit more
  theme-friendlier ;).

- Some current working directory trickery is now in place avoiding JACK
  session directories to ever be picked as default, as much as possible.

- Ghost-playbacks are now avoided on audio clips that are artificially
  extended beyond their own audio file lengths.

- Recording clips now shown in a reddish shade; also, it's all now shown
  a bit more correctly, regarding the lead and within looping range.

- Custom tempo spin-box widgets now honoring the decimal point cursor
  positioning for integral up/down tempo value stepping.

- Audio recording latency is now compensated via automatic clip
  offsetting.

- Audio peak file generation is now pipelined on a single unique thread,
  instead of old one per audio clip file basis.

- MIDI tempo/time-signature map import problem has been hopefully fixed.

- Session and track names are now sanitized from slashes (fixes bug#
  625798@bugs.debian.org).

- Mouse wheel effect to sliders is now reversed.

- An appropriate export filename is now suggested as default (Track/export
  Tracks...).

- Follow-playhead automatism is now temporarily suspended while mouse
  cursor hovering prompts for any editing action (applies to main track-
  view and MIDI clip editor/piano-roll).

- Audio vs. MIDI time drift correction now takes jack_frame_time() as
  audio time reference.

- Audio buffering internal synchronization logic gets it bartered: three
  bools for a single byte flag.

- Connections are now preserved as possible when changing bus properties
  (View/Buses.../Update).

- A rare audio clip looping out-of-sync condition got squared, hopefully
  the last ;)

- Yet again, the audio clip buffer/disk-streaming optimization has been
  almost completely redrawn: now there's one thread per audio track.

- Not replacing a session directory that already exists on loading an
  archive file (.qtz) is now fixed with an usable brand new untitled
  session.

- The major thread optimization has been slightly improved: the audio clip
  buffer/disk-streaming thread is now served in a FIFO manner (was LIFO).

- Custom time/tempo spin-box widget change fixup.

- Audio clip filename change segfault/crash fixed.

- Make sure all clips in multiple recording tracks start and end at the
  very same position whenever recording is already engaged and rolling.

- Hopeful fix to a potential audio buffering race condition, which was a
  probable cause of random muted clips.

- Avoid recursive observer widget value updates.

- Almost complete rewrite of the main track-view selection and redrawing
  logic, taking advantage of the fundamentally static graphical backstore.

- Autonomic resizing of mixer bus splitter sizes.

- Improved timing for monitored MIDI events being buffered though MIDI
  instrument plugins, while playback/transport is rolling.

- Audio peak/waveform is now slightly tweaked from the early optimization
  days (master C++ guru has always said that was root of all evil anyway :).

- MIDI controller mapping now with "Invert" value option. Also, new
  "Inputs" and "Outputs" buttons have been added as helpers for MIDI
  control port connections access.

- Main left pane vertical splitter resize hack,  avoiding some track list
  update re-entrancy.

- Inserting a LV2 instrument/synth plugin on an audio track or bus were
  causing immediate crash, now fixed (give or take some event buffer stub).

- Plugin Activate All/Deactivate All menu fixing.

- Make sure given session directory has all the necessary access
  permission (read/write) while on session properties dialog.

- Dedicated audio outputs setting for instrument plugins inserted on the
  MIDI track properties dialog were not being honored, now fixed.

- Force update/close of all MIDI clips and their respective editors
  (piano-roll) if open, when changing the global session tempo (BPM).

- Removed the misleading "(Any)" special channel value while on MIDI
  controllers/learn dialog.

- Floating tool-tips now being shown also while on mouse rubber-banding
  (drag-select).

- Audio clip pitch-shifting change fixing; also, tooltips now showing
  semitones units instead of a clueless percentage.

- Rendering audio wave-forms while recording is now a little bit smoother
  than before.

- New main track-view clip selection tool: invert current selection
  (Edit/Select/Invert). The MIDI clip editor (piano-roll) also gets proper
  range selection tool (Edit/Select/Range).

- More eye-candy: muted/non-soloed tracks are now slightly shaded on the
  main track-view.

- A major hidden optimization has been implanted: all audio clip
  buffer/disk-streaming threads are finally merged into a single
  multiplexing thread (was one thread per audio clip longer than 3 sec.
  which was quite wasteful and creepy;).

- All plugin list view changes are now properly signaled to track
  properties and bus manager dialogs and enable their respective
  acceptance.

- Two brand new MIDI tools make their appearance: Scale-Quantize and
  Snap-to-Scale. The later may be readily accessible from the MIDI clip
  editor toolbar and menu (check View/Toolbars/Scale and View/Scale).

- Mixer track strips are now completely redone whenever a track gets moved
  or re-ordered on main track list-view.

- Transport auto-backward option is now honored whenever a new session
  gets loaded.

  gtk_init() as for LV2 GTK UI support stabilization.

- Tempo tap helper button was added to View/Tempo Map... dialog.

- Executable DSSI plug-in GUI detection fixed.

- Backout default session directory after cleaning up extracted
  archive/zip bundle session (.qtz).

- Files widget item selection feedback/focus fix.

- MIDI editor anchor event floating tool-tip fix.

- Probable fix for GtkStyle usage detection (might be gentoo specific).


0.4.8  2011-01-18  The Fiery Demigoddess

- MIDI controller mapping/learn is now possible on all mixer controls
  (monitor, gain, panning, record, mute, solo).

- An internal rewrite (aka. refactoring) have been carried out, making
  sure that all track state action buttons (R, M, S) are now all under the
  observer pattern umbrella.

- Single track range selection is now available on main menu
  (Edit/Select/Track Range; default keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+R);
  additionally to vertical range and horizontal track actions
  (Edit/Select/Range, Track) all these operations can now toggle over the
  previous selection.

- Direct clip selection from Files list item has been brute-forcefully
  implemented (after being challenged by Jiri Prochaszka aka Anchakor:).

- Files tree widget sticky "New Group" item fixed.

- A new menu option has been added (View/Tool Tips) to show/hide a
  floating tool-tip while dragging, moving, resizing or pasting selected
  clips or events over the main tracks view and MIDI clip editor
  (piano-roll) respectively, displaying current target position and
  status.

- Attempt to reset audio/MIDI time drift compensator on every engine start
  and loop turnaround.

- Moving the punch-out marker over the main track time ruler was failing
  to shrink the punch-in/out range, now it does (not).

- MIDI clip tools (quantize, transpose, normalize, randomize, resize,
  rescale and the new timeshift) are now all accessible from the main
  tracks view (Edit/Clip/Tools menu) and apply to all events on current
  selected  clip(s).

- LV2 Persist extension support is being introduced.

- A new timeshift MIDI tool has been added, after an awesome patch by
  Jiri Prochaszka aka Anchakor; applies to selected events between edit
  markers, distorting their time and duration (optionally), either
  slowing down and accelerating, based on a given parameter P value.

- Audio clip/buffer pitch-shifting fixes with regard to latency correction
  due on the RubberBand library one-pass (real-time) processing mode.

- New Send Gain and Dry/Wet control parameters have been implemented for
  audio Inserts pseudo-plugins.

- MIDI channel/master volume enqueued events are now affected by the
  current track/bus volume (0-100%).

- Prevent old rounding error when resetting to plugin parameter default
  value with the mouse middle-button click while hovering a slider widget
  (observer).

- A quantize percentage has been added to MIDI clip editor quantize tool
  (Tool/Quantize...) for time and duration quantization (0% for none; 100%
  for full regular quantization).

- Metronome bus/ports are now created at engine start and not when user
  switches it on anymore.

- Make sure all audio clip buffers are in sync upon smooth-ramping going
  off and playback is rolling.

- Copy-pasting across controller event types is now possible on the MIDI
  clip editor (aka piano-roll).

- Finally indulged, the genuine transport stop button makes its appearance
  on main toolbar and menu.

- Main tracks grid visibility option (View/Snap/Grid).

- Yet another off-by-one (frame) audio buffer bug got squashed away: rare
  symptom was that some audio clips were being left dead silent right
  after playback of their first looping period.

- Plugin parameter name/label now a proper attribute of its respective
  MIDI Controller observer instance, allowing to be shown on dialog title
  (MIDI learn).

- Default session file format saved on JACK session demand is now the
  bundle archive/zip one (.qtz).

- Plugin selection dialog now shows whether a plugin features its own
  editor (GUI) and/or external state configuration (EXT).

- Help/Shortcuts... window positioning and sizing are now preserved.

- All plugin chain changes over the track properties dialog now sure
  counts as a dirty action.

- Newly extracted archive/zip session directories are now removed
  automatically from the file-system on session close, prompting the user
  for confirmation (cf. View/Options.../Display/Confirm Removals).

- Ctrl+mouse-wheel is now set for zooming in/out, on main track-view and
  all applicable MIDI clip editor views (piano-roll), according to current
  zoom mode (see View/Zoom Horizontal, Vertical or All for both ways
  simultaneously).

- New MIDI clip editor (piano-roll) mouse hovering effect (eye-candy++).

- After too many a user request, a brand new session archive file type is
  being introduced (.qtz) which tries to bundle in one single zip archive
  all the media and contents of a session.

- Add that to eye-candy: either loop or punch-in/out outer ranges are now
  shaded on the main track-view, thumb-view and MIDI clip editor
  (piano-roll) views.

- LV2 GTK UI plug-in hosting is now roaring its ugly head.

- Ignore all initial and decremental notifications of audio engine's
  buffer-size changes.

- Internal audio buffer loop points were not being set properly for
  non-zero clip offsets, leaving some as severely out-of-sync while
  rolling over loop turns. Now fixed again, hopefully.

- Avoid audio peak file clashing when deriving from audio sample files
  with distinct absolute paths but the very same file (base)name.

- A new MIDI editor (piano-roll) tool has been added: Rescale event times,
  durations and/or values by a percentage between 1 and 1000% (adapted
  thanks to patch by Jesse Lucas).

- Attempt to mitigate audio clip sequencing glitches on
  single-core/single-thread machines.


0.4.7  2010-09-30  The Furious Desertrix

- While moving multi-selected MIDI events around the clip editor (aka
  piano-roll), with help of keyboard arrow keys, that is, was not clear
  which one was the so-called "anchor" event, the one which positioning
  gets honored for snap-to-beat business. Not anymore: the anchor event
  now defaults to the earliest in time or the one the user's last
  point(-click)ed.

- MIDI control observer pattern implementation has sneaked in, making it
  ready for the so-called and long-awaited "MIDI Learn" feature and
  arbitrary MIDI controller assignment, for plugin parameters in
  particular.

- MMC DEFERRED PLAY doesn't cause transport state to stop if currently
  rolling.

- Audio clip merge processing might have been skipping  a few initial
  frame blocks, now fixed.

- Clip selection and plugin parameter hash optimization.

- Anti-glitch audio clip macro fade-in/out fixed again.

- New clip fade-in/out slopes (curves) are introduced, partially adapted
  and refactored from those easing equations of Robert Penner's fame.

- Clip fade-in/out non-linear slopes are now shown as actual WYSIWYG
  curves.

- Escape key now closes generic plugin widgets as ever found usual
  elsewhere.

- Picking nits: unselect current track when clicking on any gray empty
  area, also accessible from a new menu item: Track/Navigate/None.

- A nasty and deadly MIDI resolution overflow has been finally fixed,
  allowing for long MIDI sequences (1h+) to load correctly on 32bit
  machines from now on (was perfectly fine on 64bit though).

- MIDI editor selection hash optimization in face of reasonably huge event
  sequences.

- MIDI controller mapping finally refactored to support some other MIDI
  event types than just CC (0xBn) ones.

- Nitpicking fix: corrected main track-list (left pane) display when no
  track is currently selected.

- libX11 is now being added explicitly to the build link phase, as seen
  necessary on some bleeding-edge distros eg. Fedora 13, Debian 6.

- New audio metronome bar and beat sample gain options.

- Progressively, the observer pattern is being finally introduced,
  targeting all potentially automation controls and widgets as plain
  ground-zero for the (ultra-)long overdue automation feature.

- MIDI controller mapping of still non-existing tracks were being
  implicitly assigned to the last, highly numbered, existing track. Now
  fixed.

- Moving from old deprecated Qt3'ish custom event post handling into
  regular asynchronous signal/slot strategy.

- Muting/soloing tracks while playback is looping was leaving current
  audio clip out-of-sync whenever that same track is later un-muted on any
  other preceding clip. Now hopefully fixed.

- MIDI Clock support makes its first appearance.

- All tempo (BPM) calculations are now compliant to the MIDI conventional
  equivalence between beat and quarter note (1/4, crotchet) as common
  standard time division.

- Automatic audio time-stretch option is not enabled by default anymore.

- Standard warning Apply button is now only shown when dismissing dialog
  changes are actually valid.

- Make sure non-dedicated metronome and player buses are properly reset
  and reopen when changing regular audio buses (hopefully fixing bug re.
  crash after changing audio bus).

- Hopefully, an outrageously old bug got squashed away, which was causing
  random impromptu crashes, most often when importing audio clips while
  looping and play-head is any near the loop end point.

- General standard dialog buttons layout is now in place.

- Fixed main track view off-limits play-head positioning.

- Main tool-bar Time and Tempo spin-boxes, may now have their colors
  correct, as for most non-Qt based theme engines (ie. Gnome). Green text
  on black background has been and still is the the intended aspect design
  ;)

- MIDI file import and internal sequence representation has been changed
  to be inclusive on all bank-select (CC#0,32) and program-change events
  which were previously discarded while honoring MIDI track properties.
  Interleaved SysEx events are now also preserved on their original
  sequence positions instead of squashing a duplicate into the MIDI bus
  SysEx setup.

- Attempt to include the VeSTige header by default, as for minimal VST
  plugin support.

- JACK transport support has been slightly rewritten, in fact the sync
  callback is now in effect for repositioning.

- The MIDI clip editor (piano roll) widget won't be flagged as a tool
  window anymore.

- A tempo adjustment tool is making inroads from the menu, as
  Edit/Clip/Tempo... (factory shortcut: F7).

- Audio tracks auto-monitoring is now effective on playback.

- Make sure to ask whether a dirty MIDI clip should be saved, upon
  resizing or stretching its edges.

- Backward and Forward transport commands are now taking additional stops
  on loop points.

- Attempt to optimize track solo/mute redundant transactions, in special
  regard to MIDI track events which were being duplicated on soloing and
  temporarily muted on unsoloing.


0.4.6  2010-05-21  The Funky Deviless

- Introducing a non-painting edit sub-mode on the MIDI clip editor's
  piano-roll (see Edit/Select Mode/Edit Draw menu).

- The MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll) is now a lot more quiet about
  saving its own dirty content, delegating all salvage questions to main
  session control.

- Don't show session restart message box when changing JACK transport mode
  option anymore.

- Dedicated MIDI control bus switching fixed. Was closing the wrong bus
  eventually and crashing the whole show with it.

- MIDI bank/program backout has been corrected on MIDI track properties
  dialog rejection (ie. user cancellation).

- MIDI bank select method has been corrected for tracks with no instrument
  defined.

- LV2 UI Instance and Data Access extension support added; reduce LV2
  external UI parameter value update flickering.

- JACK session infrastructure support.

- Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic has been
  slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures due to wrong main
  widget hidden state.

- Initial mixer widget extents are now set reasonably larger.

- General source tree layout and build configuration change.

- Ever since smooth-ramping introduction that having at least one
  input-only buses were causing immediate playback crashes, now hopefully
  fixed.

- Refactored for common engine client nomenclature, primarily provided by
  JACK, then secondarily passed to ALSA Sequencer, getting rid of the
  JackUseExactName requirement and lifting the unique/single instance
  restriction in the process.

- Current JACK Transport, MMC Device, and MIDI Song Position pointer (SPP)
  control modes are now saved/loaded as part of session option properties.

- MIDI clip editor's context menu crash on Qt >= 4.6 has been fixed.

- An ancient double-free corruption has been finally fixed at the
  audio/MIDI bus connection persistence logic.

- Improved visibility of track state buttons text (R, M, S) when turned on
  dark colored themes.

- LV2 Save/Restore extension support kicks off.

- MIDI engine read-ahead period has been shortened to half than it was
  since inception--now it's a 500msec cycle.

- MIDI clip editor event list gets its due inline editing, for time, note,
  value/velocity and duration columns, just one double-click away over the
  target cell ;)

- Add-plugin selection dialog position and extent are now remembered
  across invocations and application sessions (tipping by Frank Neumann).

- MIDI clip time-stretching is now made available through the same
  gestures as audio ones, by just shift+dragging either of the clip edges.

- Drag-and-copying plug-in instances (cloning) is now fixed with regard to
  parameter value replication.

- MIDI clip editor snap-per-beat setting is now independent from main
  multi-track view; File/Save As... dialog fixed; the current event
  selection is now kept floating as long as it's possible after editing
  command actions; finally, edit mode has been extended to free-hand event
  drawing, chalking off (piano roll) draw mode from the TODO list.

- Swing-quantize has finally made its overdue debut as an additional MIDI
  clip editor tool (see Tools/Quantize...).

- Almost since its inception, audio inserts were injecting garbage random
  noise when not being activated, now fixed.

- Dedicated audio output ports for MIDI track plugins, now have their
  connection persistence back in business due on session load.


0.4.5  2010-01-23  A Friskier Demivierge ;)

- Changing loop points while playback is rolling, with the play-head any
  near, was leaving audio clips out-of-sync.

- MIDI event list view was missing some selected items with the very same
  onset time, now fixed.

- When failing to detect a SSE enabled build, the CFLAGS variables are
  now properly restored to their previous sane state, preventing all
  subsequent dependency tests from false positives (bug# 565860
  @bugs.debian.org).

- MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll) multiple selection has been fixed
  (again) re. move/paste-snapping consistency.


0.4.4  2010-01-16  The Frisky Demivierge

- For all the DSSI plugins that have output control ports, a host
  feedback/update process cycle is now being finally provided: all output
  control ports are now marshaled to their respective GUI process, rather
  often and when found open/visible.

- MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll) snap-to-beat behavior on edit mode is
  now kind of more like 'filling-in-the-blanks' (as Frank Neumann et al.
  wishes ;)

- Fixed MIDI clip editor mistake when reverting to initial clip length,
  before closing and discard changes (thanks to Frank Neumann, for
  spotting this one).

- LADISH Level 1 support has been added: SIGUSR1 signal trap just makes it
  a shortcut to File/Save.

- Avoid parameter value flickering, due to duplicate command invocation,
  most evident when changing values massively on native Linux VSTi plugin
  editor GUIs (thanks to a detailed report on this odd behavior, from Mike
  of linuxDSP.co.uk).

- Another TODO item bites the dust: MIDI event list editor, now acessible
  from the MIDI clip editor menu (View/Events)

- Last used session directory is now made current on startup only when no
  filename is given on the command line.

- Current snap-to-beat setting (time quantization) now affects the anchor
  event only, while dragging, moving and/or pasting multiple events over
  the MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll).

- Make anti-glitch audio clip micro fade-in/outs independent from current
  buffer size as much as possible.

- Audio/MIDI engine drift correction gets really sophisticated, with the
  help of (now old) ALSA MIDI tempo skew facility.

- Edit/Clip/Import... menu option is now available for expedite clip
  insertion from audio and MIDI file requesters.

- Set default session directory effective to file's location.

- Audio track/clip recording process has been target to special
  refactorization across the internal audio engine process cycle,
  in a late attempt to get self-bounce/recording effective and working
  consistently for all track layouts.

- All session related dialogs are now set to window modality, (were set to
  default application modality before) allowing for continued input focus
  and interaction on all plugin/tool windows.

- An off-by-one nasty old bug fixed in audio clip drawing, was causing
  instant crashes on certain zoom levels of the main track view.

- Graphical MIDI clip representation regarding note/pitch range is now
  kept as much as possible across clip edits (cut, copy, paste, drag,
  move, delete, etc.)

- LV2 plug-in hosting has finally come into actual implementation; only
  some and the most basic LV2 plug-in features are supported at the
  moment; probably there's no big advantage against the old LADSPA ones;
  there's some support for external UIs though; also, LV2 MIDI/Event
  bare-bones support is included but chances are it won't build nor work
  right on most of the setups out there. It's a WIP host implementation
  anyways, as is the  whole LV2 spec. for that matter ;)

- Connections filter is now reset when widget is shown through the
  View/Connections main menu or toolbar button.

- Audio bus auto-connection option is now applied when creating or
  updating, newer or existing buses, respectively.

- Global configuration state is now explicitly saved/committed to disk
  whenever View/Options... dialog changes are applied or when a session is
  loaded or saved.

- Audio ramping spin-locking makes its smooth stuff, in an attempt to
  reduce glitching and crackling when editing (due to its own pseudo
  spin-locking) and toggling playback states.

- JACK Transport, MMC Device, and MIDI Song Position pointer (SPP)
  control modes are now made optional (View/Options...), allowing for
  discretionary configuration: None/Disabled, Slave/Input, Master/Output
  or Full/Duplex  (default).

- Session files may now be dragged and dropped over the main track view
  and get loaded for business as usual (once quietly ignored).

- In an attempt to mitigate potential stack corruption and sudden crashes,
  old commented out session pseudo-locks are now back in business while
  executing clip editing commands (cut, paste, drag, move, insert, delete)
  and playback is currently rolling.

- Adjusted first-time application window size to fit into 800x600 screen
  size and with reasonable initial dockables layout.

- Avoid duplicate snap-to-grid effect when changing the length of MIDI
  clip editor events across non-zero clip offsets (after a glitch reported
  by Ralf Mardorf).

- Late audio track processing optimization, suppressing all plugin, mixer
  and monitor pass-through activity when given track is muted, either
  explicitly or implicitly (ie. other track is in solo state).

- Entering System Exclusive events (SysEx) on the MIDI clip editor (aka
  matrix/piano-roll widget), yet something not fully supported anyway,
  even though allowed in edit mode, doesn't crash the whole damn thing
  anymore, while saving the clip to a file.

- Strict aliasing avoidance, with plain and demanded use of 'union', as
  much as to stop nagging warnings from gcc >= 4.4.1 (last seen on
  src/qtractorMidiEvent.h hackery).

- Visual correct play-head position while changing zoom levels, applicable
  to both main track and MIDI clip editor views.


0.4.3  2009-10-05  The Fussy Doula

- External preset files are not removed nor deleted from the file-system
  anymore.

- Connections support for UTF-8 encoded client/port names.

- Force track and clip properties dialog widget to be modal as it should
  from their beginning dawn.

- Audio effect send/return aux. inserts are implemented as special
  pseudo-plugins (Plugins/Inserts).

- Reset play-head position on auto-backward and keep playback rolling when
  continue past end transport option is not set.

- MIDI clip editor (aka piano-roll/matrix aditor) gets better on the
  virtual piano keyboard eye-candy side of things ;).

- Plugins are now also referenced by label, avoiding plugin index
  clash/misses eg. when plugin object file/path changes or is moved
  externally.

- Keyboard focus is now cleared/reset from the main toolbar time and tempo
  spin-boxes when editing gets finished (eg. Enter key is pressed).

- First audio metronome beat/bar now played back correctly.

- Client to/from port (dis)connections now found consistent as good
  ol'QjackCtl behavior.

- All dirty open MIDI clip editors are now prompted to save before the
  main application closes.

- Mixer level meters get their long deserved gradient look.

- Fixed any ghost clip selections that were haunting the main track view,
  specially after undo/redo.

- Increased tolerance on reading corrupt MIDI files (SMF).

- A MIDI SysEx manager is being finally introduced, in some primordial
  rather basic form though. MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx) event strings
  may now be freely assigned to MIDI output buses only, allowing for
  proper setup of external outboard MIDI equipment. Each bus may have
  an unlimited SysEx queue that gets sent out on every connection change
  (see View/Buses.../MIDI/SysEx...).

- A default MIDI instrument name may now be assigned to any MIDI output
  bus (see View/Buses.../MIDI).

- More legacy headers, stdio.h and stdlib.h, are yet again necessary to
  build with gcc/g++ >= 4.4 (as patch noted by Alexis Ballier on Gentoo
  bug report #274168, thanks).

- Bus manager dialog (View/Buses...) gets new columns on the left pane
  buses list as for displaying number of channels and bus mode.

- Crash when updating bus probably fixed.

- Fixed glitch displaying beat snap/grid lines on MIDI clip editor,
  incidental to clips located at absolute zero time.

- Overlapped MIDI clips were rendering garbled note events to DSSI/VSTi
  plugins, now fixed.

- New MIDI Playback/Queue timer (resolution) option is now available (see
  View/Options.../MIDI).

- MIDI instrument definitions may now be imported from plain SoundFont
  files.


0.4.2  2009-06-04  The Flaunty Demoness

- The MIDI clip editor (piano-roll/matrix editor), the main track view as
  well, have been subject to usability fixing, the most notable avoids
  clearing current selection as much as possible when updating view
  contents (eg. changing zoom levels does not reset current selection
  anymore).

- MIDI tracks channel bank/program and controller stuff are now only
  issued when the respective bus connections have changed, seldom on every
  playback start.

- MIDI controller mapping infrastructure, with file based configuration
  management (see View/Controllers...), is now in place, following an
  original contribution from gizzmo aka Mathias Krause.

- Plugin chain buffer reset on playback start/stop is not guarded by a
  momentary plugin de/activation anymore.

- Clip export may now be applied to multiple clips, sharing common
  refactored code and same semantics as merging of current selected clips.

- Improved, may be just fixed yet again, audio track export
  synchronization and reliability.

- Clip merge is now featured both for audio and MIDI tracks (see
  Edit/Clip/Merge...).

- Improved, or better said, fixed (again) the precision of multi-clip
  final positioning as result of drag/move and paste operations in main
  track view.

- MIDI track program number is now listed in 1-128 range, in an attempt to
  be consistent with corresponding MIDI track dialog drop-down list.

- MIDI editor snap grid lines get slight different color then regular beat
  divisions.

- Reset local tempo map cursor on newer MIDI file imports in a tentative
  to fix incidental but random crashes.


0.4.1  2009-04-04  The Funky Dominatrix

- MIDI editor command item execution order has been fixed, correcting the
  redo/undo adjustment of overlapping note events.

- MIDI clip editor (aka. piano-roll/matrix editor) sees one of its most
  wanted features introduced: visual snap grid, now accessible through
  View/Snap/Grid option toggle.

- Actual non-zero session length gets back to status bar of main
  application window.

- One potential buffer-overflow/memory-corruption crash bug has been
  fixed, long due on most audio (down) sample-rate conversions and
  affecting audio export in particular.

- MIDI track/channel patch information, ie. bank-select and program-change
  events, are now being properly set on MIDI track/clip export.

- SSE optimization is back in town after being mysteriously disabled since
  its dawn :/

- Looping and punch-recording now actively mutual exclusive states:
  setting either one unsets the other off and vice- versa. Also,
  punch-in/out is now made an undoable command.

- Moving tracks, any track, up or down, were leaving MIDI playback and
  meter monitoring completely out-of-sync, now fixed.

- Automatic crash-dump reports, debugger stack-traces (gdb), back-traces,
  whatever, are being introduced as a brand new configure option
  (--enable-stacktrace) and default enabled on debug build targets
  (--enable-debug).

- Audio/MIDI drift correction is now progressive, taking a least
  significant differential approach, on every read- ahead cycle and
  swallowed on loop turn-arounds, as before.

- Improved Edit/Clip/Normalize and Quantize commands, now affecting the
  whole extended multi-clip selection.

- Playback is now being temporarily suspended while either transport
  rewind or fast-forward rolling is engaged.

- A bad and shame-on-me bug was fixed: this was hideously affecting any
  track/clip playback synchronization, most noticeable after toggling
  solo/mute track states while playback is rolling and skipping the
  play-head backward over more than one clip under the same track.

- A floating-rectangle flip that showed while dragging new files beyond
  the left of main track view is now gone.

- MIDI note event truncation on both track and clip export has been fixed.


0.4.0  2009-03-13  The Foxy Dryad

- MIDI (re)connections fix; now caring for the ALSA client and port
  textual names only, avoiding as much as possible, any reliance on those
  volatile client and port numbers.

- Transport/Backward and Forward commands may now reset to immediate full
  start or end of session locations, by just pressing the Shift or Ctrl
  keyboard modifiers and clicking their respective toolbar buttons.

- Default session/MIDI resolution has been set to 960 ticks per beat (960
  TPQN, where a beat equals a quarter-note); it is worth of note that the
  previous default resolution was set to one order of magnitude lower, ie.
  96 TPQN ;).

- Making (dis)connections now also flags session as dirty.

- Internal Audio/MIDI engines queue/time drift correction takes a brand
  new approach, specially adapted to rolling tempo/time-signature changes.

- MIDI monitor refresh-cycle slight internal optimization.

- Converted obsolete QMessageBox forms to standard buttons.

- Transport/Rewind and Fast-forward commands may now be set to double
  -speed, by pressing the Shift or Ctrl modifiers while clicking their
  respective tool buttons.

- MIDI clip editor zoom ratios are now saved and preserved across
  sessions.

- Time-signature is now directly accessible from the main tempo spin-box
  which also reflects current tempo status.

- Time/frame spin-boxes now allow to step change each field individually,
  depending on the cursor beam position.

- Make sure that Transport/Follow playhead option is only effective when
  playback is actually rolling.

- Primordial attempt to include MIDI Song Position Pointer (SPP), Song
  Start, Stop and Continue sequencing support.

- A completely new time-scale infrastructure is now in place, with full
  support for session tempo and time-signature map; this long due feature
  is primarily accessible through the main menu, View/Tempo Map...; also
  by double-clicking on the the main window and MIDI clip editor time
  rulers and left-clicking on the main toolbar tempo/signature spin-box.

- Moving and resizing individual clips now cares for track proper ordering
  and overlapping changes, avoiding nasty out of sequence clips and other
  unpredictable effects.

- An expedite MIDI clip quantize command is now available from the main
  track view menu (Edit/Clip/Quantize), which simply applies the current
  snap-to-beat setting to a MIDI clip range selection.

- Fixed that hideous bug affecting overlapped audio clips when playhead
  gets moved backward, causing the playback of those audio clips in
  particular, go out of sync.

- Tracks are now limited to their minimum height, specially effective in
  face of vertical zooming.

- Zoom mode option introduced (on menu View/Zoom/Horizontal, Vertical,
  All).

- Tempo beat type is a new session property; however it is not yet user
  modifiable and currently disabled to default MIDI quarter note (1/4).

- All open MIDI clip editor time-scales are now updated and corrected when
  the main session time base changes (tempo, time-signature, resolution,
  etc.)

- MIDI metronome fixed, preventing duplicate click events.

- MP3 audio file decoding was broken for way too long and falling short
  for every file with custom frames, ID3 tags and comments. Got shamefully
  fixed.

- Time signature denominator (ie. beat divisor) is now an accessible and
  effective session property.

- Attempt to retain original size (clip length) of all audio clips when
  changing the global session tempo and automatic time-stretching is not
  an option.


0.3.0  2008-12-25  The Fluffy Doll

- Almost complete rewrite of the plugin configuration and parameter
  initialization logic.

- MIDI bank/program selection is now taken into account on plugins
  initialization and replication.

- Fixed initial parameter values for native VST plugins.

- Track form plugin lists are now properly (re)initialized when track type
  changes.

- Generic plugin forms now have the option to show/hide the parameter
  widgets through the new "Params" button.

- New auto-monitor toggle option (menu Track/Auto Monitor): the current
  selected track is now set on monitor and MIDI channel omni-mode
  automagically, as a convenient workflow feature (kindly suggested by
  Holborn).

- MIDI clip editor Tools menu is not disabled anymore when there's no
  selection, drop-down menu items are instead.

- Make all recorded clips to honor either the punch-out or play-head
  accumulated position; resolve all pending MIDI sequence note events on
  record stop/close.

- Major silent move: audio plugins chain are now applied in a
  pre-fader/meter basis as is usually implied from the mixer strip layout
  ie. signal flows from the top to the bottom.

- All MIDI buses may now have plugins inserted so that  multi-timbral
  synth/sampler plugins get driven to their fullness.

- MIDI track plugin's dedicated audio output bus may now be effective, as
  it seems, good old master audio output bus was being used, no matter
  what.

- Paste-repeat command has been introduced, now allowing to replicate and
  concatenate the clipboard contents over the time-line, with a given
  repeat-count and optional period (see menu Edit/Paste Repeat... on the
  main and MIDI clip editor windows).

- Normalize tool on MIDI clip editor got rewritten from its previous
  brain-dead, useless and utterly wrong operation.

- All time offsets and lengths are now zero-bar/beat based when displayed
  in the BBT (bar.beat.ticks) format.

- MMC STEP gets adjusted to current snap-per-beat setting.

- Fixed broken initial buffering that was randomly crippling those audio
  clips that fit integrally in cached and while on playback.

- Fix initialization of multiple instances of DSSI plugins which implement
  run_multiple_synths (eg. fluidsynth-dssi), preventing an instant crash
  on activation.

- Exclude deprecated VST elements from compilation.

- Export tracks dialog has new punch in/out range option.

- Somehow realized that looping and punch-recording are two mutually
  exclusive states, at least until loop recording (ie. takes) gets real.

- Fixed crash on tempo change; affecting the WSOLA based time-stretching
  on all non-stereo audio clips.

- Incomplete audio peaks were being cached prematurely, fixed.

- Make way for paste/dropping items from the system clipboard over the
  main track view. Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete of file items have now this
  workaround fixed, wrt. Files widget keyboard shortcuts, respectively.

- Clip gain/volume propriety is now in place and reflected in audio clip
  waveform drawing in particular.

- A new hideous progress bar is now lurking in the main status line, as
  found convenient to display progress of the also new clip tools
  (normalize, export, etc.).

- Clip normalize tool is now available (Edit/Clip/Normalize).

- Audio and MIDI clip file export is now available as a tool (see
  Edit/Clip/Export...).

- Punch in/out (range) recording is now in experimental shape, with
  minimal settings and functionality, already accessible through the
  main menus, transport toolbars and visible on main tracks view and
  MIDI editors as magenta colored line markers.

- External MIDI control events for channel volume (7) and channel panning
  (10) are now handled properly through session tracks.

- Session file templates make its debut with new usability option, on
  whether new sessions are created based on existing template file (see
  View/Options.../Display/Session/New session template; nb. session
  templates are just regular session files but loaded and saved with no
  media content (no clips nor files).

- Grayed/disabled palette color group fix for dark color themes.

- Implicit attempt to flush all pending notes for some, if not most plugin
  instruments (eg. VSTi), on playback stop.

- Fait-divers: desktop menu file touched to openSUSE conventions.

- Internal refactoring alert: Session and Options instances are now being
  redesigned as singletons, preparing to get out of the way from the
  master GUI/MainForm instance.

- Clip drawing methods refactored so let the fade-in/out handles get seen
  with transparency over the clip graphics content.

- Reset and continue looping even still when continue past end transport
  option is not set and playback is rolling.


0.2.2  2008-10-05  The Flirty Ditz

- Slight optimization in audio and MIDI meters refresh rate.

- Another ancient bug has been squashed: MIDI events were being recorded
  even though recording wasn't rolling; spurious event times were being
  recorded due to an absent started queue.

- Major fix applied to audio track monitor metering, and most importantly
  to plugin processing, correcting tentatively all audio buffer offsetting
  and slicing due on loop turnarounds.

- Fixed a potential crash and/or simple record dismissal when changing
  properties of a track already armed for recording; prevent record
engaged  tracks from editing or removal.

- Lighten up the connections line and highlight colors, as seen to fit
  best on some darker background themes.

- Several icons refined with slight transparent shadowing.

- Send/reset all MIDI buses and track controllers (ie. volume and panning)
  only when main transport playback is started, avoiding the pouring on
  eg. loop, playhead or tempo changes.

- Pressing the Escape key also clears current selection in the main
  track-view and MIDI clip editor; resizing multiple events at once
  doesn't need help from Shift or Ctrl modifiers anymore.

- DSSI and VSTi plugins get all their default parameters values reset on
  MIDI program change.

- Several major fixes have been applied to the MIDI clip editor, regarding
  snap precision and correctness, most specially due on clips which
  weren't located on exact bar boundaries.

- Brand new usability feature introduced: mute, solo and monitor toggling
  may now be applied to all tracks in session at once, when issued with
  either the Shift or Ctrl keyboard modifiers, which will set or reverse
  respectively all other tracks state.

- Audio buses plugin chain may be also accessed and edited from the
  extended bus management dialog (View/Buses...).

- MIDI meter level default color is now set distinct from the old
  lime-green one as in audio level meters.

- MIDI clip editor is now a genuine top-level window, fixing all keyboard
  shortcut ambiguities with main application window.

- Mixer splitter panes are now collapsible and optionally hidden.

- Make MIDI instrument patch management a little more sane, as for
  preventing the accidental insertion of blank instrument names and
  automatic default bank/program selection in track properties.

- All connections are now based exclusively on the textual client and port
  names, effective in particular to match MIDI bus ports with disregard to
  their volatile numerical identification.

- MIDI file (SMF) header endianess fix (PPC users rejoyce:))

- Record armed tracks aren't muted for playback anymore, as this was a
  severe crippling nuisance regarding input monitoring and all mighty
  user experience after recording a simple take; for instance, as the
  bottom line goes, there's no need to un-arm a track from its record
  -enabled state anymore, for just recorded material get heard on
  immediate playback; kick  on the jam!

- Playhead position overflow fixed on negative MMC STEP commands.

- Thumb-view width proportions now based on minimal slack session length
  instead of the auto-extending track-view contents width.

- Optimize audio clip drawing, most specially on zoomed-out levels.

- Bring the audio peak frames into some sort of cache, preventing
  recurrent peak frame buffer reallocation and trashing.


0.2.1  2008-08-30  The Fainty Diva

- Gradient eye-candy now featured for clips, tracks and mixer strips
  widget backgrounds, disabled on configure time (--disable-gradient).

- MIDI pitch-bend/wheel events are now captured/recorded properly; in
  fact, there was this ancient bug, now squashed, as all MIDI clips
  weren't being stored at all if there weren't a single note event
  captured.

- MIDI channel translation is finally in effect on monitored tracks,
  specially the ones set in omni-channel input mode.

- MIDI open files dialog gets a few more file filter types now.

- Playhead position is now shown, updated and can be also set on the main
  toolbar session thumb-view (Shift-click to set the playhead).

- The floating selection, as shown for a clipboard pasting operation, has
  been corrected regarding time scale (horizontal zoom) changes, while in
  the main track-view. Also fixed final position snapping precision.

- Current tempo and snap-per-beat setting now survive session cycling.

- DSSI plugins implementing run_multiple_synths (eg. fluidsynth-dssi) are
  now formally supported according to the DSSI spec (hopefully); note that
  previously one could only have one DSSI plugin instance loaded in
  session in any given time, otherwise a sudden crash was in sure demand
  when either  plugin got activated.

- Audio plugin outputs now overrides each other when the number of output
  ports does not match the number of mix-down audio channels and thus
  fixing a nasty crash bug in the process.

- All custom font sizes are now set relative to default global font.

- Changing loop points by dragging on the time rulers is now mapped as
  undoable/redoable commands as it ought to be ever since.

- Drop-span option (View/Options.../Drop multiple audio files into the
  same track) now takes into effect the current session snap-per-beat
  setting when concatenating multiple audio clips.

- All plugins get their default bank/program selected on insertion.

- Make record armed tracks muted for playback, a needed regression to let
  both audio and MIDI tracks behave consistently regarding input monitor
  switching through output.

- Fixed a pretty old and shameless bug regarding MIDI clip recording, in
  which cases the queue start time offset was not taken into account, with
  captured events being recorded with erratic long delays.

- Almost complete refactoring of the clumsy audio peak file classes,
  possibly making it even clumsier but straight neverthless, with the
  noble and final aim to build it in-flight and draw the waveforms while
  recording  is rolling.

- Recording clips get their initial name labels drawn while fade-in/out
  handles are dropped as found pretty useless while recording.

- Escape key now closes connections and mixer widgets as found usual.


0.2.0  2008-07-18  The Frolic Demoiselle

- MIDI clip filename revision logic is now introduced, thus avoiding the
  proliferation of several numbered SMF's on each edit/save; some lurking
  bugs were exposed in the MIDI clip externalization method but promptly
  squashed.

- Fixed a mouse release event glitch while in drag-and-drop items in the
  Files tree list widget.

- A dummy plugin type option has been devised, just to bear with some
  troubled behavior of the lovely JUCETICE plugins (View/Options.../
  Plugins/Experimental/Dummy VST plugin scan). Bad news are that all, yes
  all as in every native VST plugins, are indistinguishable from being
  just pure audio effects, either mono or stereo, whatever, and thus all
  being considered full-blown stereo VSTi instruments (which are the vast
  mainstream and rather interesting majority, nevertheless:).

- The plugin selection dialog (Add Plugin...) now features the option
  whether the selected plugins should be activated on insert.

- Mixer strip titles now have distinguishable type icons, either for audio
  or MIDI, and shown on all buses and track strips.

- Major optimization breakthrough: muted audio tracks aren't streamed any
  longer, saving precious CPU cycles from decoding, resampling,
  pitch-shifting, time-stretching, plugin effects, whatever.

- Incredible as it might be, audio/MIDI track record monitoring is now
  mixed (or merged) with rolling playback content, thus not as mutually
  exclusive between record and playback states anymore; also, track
  mute/solo states doesn't apply to recording material anymore.

- Main form timer slot gets corrected and now independent of current
  process buffer-size in regard to JACK transport synchronization.

- All file references in session state file are now stored as relative
  paths to main session directory.

- DSSI/VSTi plugin presets can now be explicitly recalled from file (ie.
  Open/load preset) through this new tool button whether visible while in
  the generic plugin form.

- Due to some trouble with newer Qt >= 4.4 applications regarding font
  size configuration, a new global user option is now available to the
  rescue: View/Options... /Display/Base font size (default is no-op).

- Logarithmic scale is now taken into effect by control parameter sliders,
  in the generic plugin editor dialog as provided by LADSPA and DSSI
  plugin types.

- MIDI track bank/program does not default to zero (PC#0) anymore.

- Second attempt for Qt4.4 build support, regarding the bundled atomic
  primitives, now corrected and way more seriously :).

- Long due DSSI/VSTi plugin host implementation has taken shape for MIDI
  instruments (eg. soft-synth plugins); DSSI reached its full host
  implementation and VSTi is already kicking as well.

- DSSI/VSTi plugin presets may now be stored to external XML files, which
  should include all parameter values and configuration data chunks, taken
  as proper state snapshot and subject for recall.

- Dedicated audio output bus option is now also accessible for all MIDI
  instrument plugins, either set globally as a default mode in
  View/Options.../Plugins/Instruments or in the plugin context menu for
  MIDI tracks, as an undoable command.

- Fixed a potential crash-exception due to freeing a null-pointer, raised
  on some ever stringent platforms and while adding tracks to empty
  sessions, which is the same to say this was crashing more than always:).

- Loop turn-around is now taken care of, as this has been found missing
  and causing noticeable gapping when un-muting or changing MIDI track
  events while in playback.

- An off-by-one bug was fixed while inside MIDI cursor backward seek
  method, which was missing all other events that have the same exact
  onset timing.

- Attempt to load Qt's own translation support and get rid of the ever
  warning startup message, unless built in debug mode. (transaction by
  Guido Scholz, while on qsynth-devel, thanks).

- Only one application instance is now allowed to be up and running, with
  immediate but graceful termination upon startup iif an already running
  instance is detected, which will see its main widget shown up
  automatically (Qt/X11 platform only).

- Clip fades have now a slight transparency.

- Avoid loop read-ahead on initial audio clip loading.

- Messages file logging makes its first long overdue appearance, with user
  configurable settings in View/Options.../Logging; options dialog was
  slightly rearranged and moved the Plugins section into a new tab page.

- Audio/MIDI drifting correction was missing its own correct and due
  (re)initialization whenever playback is (re)started; also, MIDI metering
  synchronization has been fixed once again.

- Fixed session cursor backward seeking, specially applicable when
  playback passes the end of overlapped clips.

- Fixed potential crash when opening bogus audio files.

- Time-stretch FIFO buffer implementation is now made generic, as
  template, fixing a destructor memory leak in the process.

- Include legacy headers, stdlib.h and string.h, where necessary to build
  with stricter gcc/g++ >= 4.3.


0.1.3  2008-05-02  The Frugal Damsel

- As one may find convenient sometimes, the global time display format
  (frames, time or BBT) may now be changed on the main transport time
  spin-box context menu.

- Left-clicking on the track list number column now toggles all track
  content clip selection.

- Prevent audio-buffer initialization mashups when editing short audio
  clips while playback is rolling and within clip region.

- Audio peak files gets a bit simplified, dropping the peak frame count
  from its header; peak waveform graphics are now rendered as straight
  lines when over the end of audio file.

- The drop-span option (View/Options.../Drop multiple audio files into the
  same track) now also applies when importing tracks (as in Track/Import
  Tracks/Audio...) to concatenate multiple audio clips into one and the
  same new track.

- Audio and MIDI meter level colors are now user configurable (as global
  configuration options, View/Options.../Display/Meters)

- First attempt for Qt4.4 build support, regarding the bundled atomic
  primitives, which have changed upstream as advertised (thanks to Paul
  Thomas, for spotting this one first time).

- Record monitor switch is now an accessible button option on all track
  mixer strips; for visual consistency, the old bus "thru" switch button
  has been renamed to "monitor".

- Force track-view position reset to origin on session close.

- Fixed segfault on inserting an external file into files widget.

- Mixer splitter sizes are now better saved/restored when closed.

- Track record monitoring is now a state option, being toggled from the
  Track/State/Monitor menu; applies both to audio end MIDI tracks: when
  set all input will be pass-through to the current assigned output bus,
  including track plug-ins chain.

- Session dialog gets split in its own tab components, between
  descriptive, time and view configuration ones.

- Drifting correction among audio and MIDI engines is now back, but
  avoided while recording or should it be while looping?

- Time-stretching percent value gets its semantics inverted, as thought
  consistent with ones general sense for relative stretching ie., lower to
  shrink and higher to make longer. this is a major up-side-down change
  and should affect all sessions saved with time-stretched audio clips.

- Slack space in main tracks and MIDI clip editor views are now
  proportional to viewport width, leaving enough room for drag and moving
  content past the current session length, specially at the lower zoom
  levels.

- Clip end time is now also shown on tool-tip.

- When armed for recording, MIDI tracks are now monitored and filtered
  through their own output bus, thus having the same behavior as audio
  tracks; this also implies that all record armed tracks won't playback
  their current content material when recording is engaged and rolling;
  track mute and solo states are now honored on record monitoring.

- Audio clip pitch-shifting makes its first appearance, with the optional
  help from Chris Cannam's RubberBand library.

- A new MIDI editor tool is available: note/pitch randomize.

- Avoid (re)setting the default session directory if a session cannot be
  open or loaded for some reason.

- Another nastiness bites the dust: a subtle but progressive drifting has
  been swept away from the audio buffer looping; zero buffer flushing is
  now also taken into account, which was the cause for serious drifting
  on time-stretched clips.

- A major digital audio processing bug was tamed: audio clip fade-in/outs
  are now linearly piece-wise applied, even at the clip edges, giving a
  much smoother rendering and thus mitigating the nasty click-and-pop
  artifacts that were in fact due to some early design optimization with a
  poor and sloppy implementation.


0.1.2  2008-03-23  The Frantic Dame

- Session length fixed (yet again) while extend recording; also improved
  follow-playhead switching while playback/recording.

- Whitespace sanitization gets leaner for all recorded filenames.

- Run-time SSE optimization detection has been improved while on
  configure; additionally, IEEE 32bit float specific optimizations have
  also sneaked in.

- SSE optimization is now featured over all audio monitoring, and most
  specially on audio bus buffering, lowering the CPU burden a bit while
  doing track and bus gain, pan, metering and mix-down.

- Fixed MIDI clip move into new track, preserving the original channel,
  bank and program whenever possible.

- Fixed session cursor seeking, specially regarding overlapped clips, once
  gain.

- The MIDI editor gets new menu access to current MIDI clip track (see
  File/Track/Inputs, Outputs, Properties); selection of MIDI events has
  also been improved, specially regarding overlapped note events.

- Clip split command enters the stage (see Edit/Clip/Split) about
  splitting the current (selected) clip at the current playhead position
  (red cursor line).

- Creating new clips from scratch is now finally permitted (see
  Edit/Clip/New...); additionally, the clip properties dialog is now also
  allowing for changing the filename (and track/channel as special to MIDI
  clips).

- Record armed tracks are now properly monitored and fed through their own
  output audio bus on mix-down, which includes plug-in effects processing.

- The files widget get alternating coloured rows.

- VST plug-in preset values are now being restored properly; individual
  parameter changes are now being queued for the also convenient undo/redo
  command pattern.

- Some audio clip buffer-sync tweaks have sneaked in, improving and fixing
  the rendering of full-overlapped, integrally cached and/or offset clips
  altogether.

- Stuffed one primordial shot on XInitThreads() at the main head, and let
  native VST plug-ins start behaving as they should, or not; this might be
  in fact problematic and dangerous for people who won't ever try the JUCE
  based plugins as from JUCETICE (http://www.anticore.org/jucetice), due
  to some broken locking mechanism in xcb; thanks anyway to mighty
  kRAkEn/gORe@JUCETICE for this precious hint and from who knows best.

- True deterministic session length update has due fixed.

- Track menu has new accessible actions: Track/Inputs - show current track
  input bus connections; Track/Outputs - show current track output bus
  connections; Track/State/Record - arm current track for recording;
  Track/State/Mute - mute current track; Track/State/Solo - solo current
  track; Track/Navigate/First - make current the first track;
  Track/Navigate/Previous - make current the previous track;
  Track/Navigate/Next - make current the next track; Track/Navigate/Last -
  make current the last track; Track/Move/Top - move current track to top;
  Track/Move/Up - move current track up; Track/Move/Down - move current
  track down; Track/Move/Bottom - move current track to bottom;

- View menus have new accessible actions: View/Zoom/In - horizontal and
  vertical zoom-in (Ctrl +); View/Zoom/Out - horizontal and vertical
  zoom-out (Ctrl -); View/Zoom/Reset - reset both zoom levels to default;
  View/Snap - select current snap-per-beat setting;

- Plug-in forms don't auto-open on session reload anymore.

- Keyboard shortcuts icon item (Help/Shortcuts...) sneaks in.


0.1.1   2008-02-16  The Futile Duchess

- After some great user demand, keyboard shortcuts are finally
  configurable, as found provisionally under Help/Shortcuts..., for the
  main application menu and for the MIDI editor as well.

- Debian package gets SSE optimization disabled as default.

- At least some transport actions get to be non auto-repeatable when
  pressed for much too long, as Play and Record, avoiding the tumbling
  imposed from the keyboard.

- For the first time ever, jackd auto-start is now allowed (!).

- OSC service support through liblo gets optional at configure time, now
  leading the way to proper DSSI plug-in hosting.

- All plug-in widget controls count are now capped to one hundred.

- Plugin paths setup is now made available on the options dialog,
  overriding each of respective default settings, as implicit from the
  LADSPA_PATH, DSSI_PATH and VST_PATH environment variables (see
  View/Options.../Display/Plugin Paths).

- Clip fade-in/out lengths are now kept relative to tempo changes and also
  to clip offset and length changes (clip resizes).

- Automatic time-stretching for all audio clips when session tempo
  changes, may now be disabled/enabled as a global session option (see
  View/Options.../Audio/Playback/Automatic time-stretching).

- Double-clicking on an empty area (de)selects all clips on track.

- MIDI capture (record) quantization is now an option, possibly handy for
  some jerky performance musicians, as the one found in myself ;) (see
  View/Options.../MIDI/Capture/Quantize).

- The global options dialog (View/Options...) has seen its Display tab
  page being moved back and to the right.

- Major rewrite of the plug-in infrastructure, adding primordial support
  for DSSI and native VST plug-in flavors.

- Drag-and-drop of plug-in instances are now allowed intra- and
  inter-mixer strip chains, either on tracks or buses.

- Turning track record off while recording is rolling was leaving the
  session in a inconsistent recording status, now fixed.

- A random but instant crash upon audition/pre-listening player onset was
  hopefully fixed.


0.1.0   2008-01-05  The Frivolous Debutante.

- Audio clip time-stretching makes its debut, with code adapted and
  refactored from the SoundTouch library, under the (L)GPL umbrella.

- New "Options.../Audio/Playback/Quick seek time-stretching" global
  option, providing a quick seek mode (hierarchical search) while doing
  all audio buffer time-stretching.

- Changing session tempo will automatically apply the corresponding
  time-stretch percent factor to all in-place audio clips. Audio clip
  dialog also includes a new time-stretch property setting.

- Tempo changes are now affecting clip offsets correctly, keeping the clip
  offset constant in time units (ticks), as are clip start and length
  properties already.

- Mixer splitter sizes are now properly saved/restored when hidden.

- Extended multi-selection is now featured on the files widget; all drag
  and drop functionality has been almost completely rewritten.

- SSE optimization is now enabled where available (via configure).

- Options for having separate dedicated ports for the audition/pre-
  listening player output, audio metronome output, MIDI control
  input/output and MIDI metronome output, are now in place.

- A brand new subtle option sneaks in, affecting the drag-and-drop of the
  main track-view: View/Options.../Drop multiple audio files into the same
  track, whether to drop multiple external files into new or existing
  track as concatenated audio clips.

- The audio metronome makes its debut as an alternative to the MIDI
  existing one; parameters include bar and beat audio sample files,
  accessible from the View/Options.../Audio/Metronome dialog.

- Files widget action refactorization; the files context menu gets its due
  item icons and a new menu item for direct audio player accessibility.

- MIDI time resolution changes (ppqn, ticks per beat) now tries to keep
  all session MIDI clip times unchanged as far as possible.

- MIDI channel volume and panning control change events, CC#7 and CC#10
  respectively, are now rendered unfiltered on playback.

- First rendition of the long due implementation of an audition or
  pre-listening audio player is now in place; the files window got this
  new play/stop control button on its lower-right corner.

- Actual instrument definition note (keys) and controller names are now in
  effect on the MIDI editor, whenever applicable.

- Fixed instrument bank selection method, "Bank MSB" (2), which was broken
  enough to never send the correct bank number.

- Mouse-wheel horizontal scrolling is now accessible on every view, while
  pressing a modifier key (Shift or Ctrl).

- New auto-backward transport option: when enabled the playhead will be
  reset backward automatically whenever transport stops playing.

- A suicide-crash has been fixed while invoking the bus dialog from the
  respective mixer bus strip context menu.

- Master (default) buses are always set to Duplex mode, being now an
  enforced update policy while on the Buses dialog.

- A stupid lockup bug (infinite loop) was spotted on the track bus
  assignment method and squashed (thanks, lexridge).

- New keyboard shortcuts for toggling the Connections tool (F8) and the
  mighty Mixer tool (F9) windows.

- Avoid showing a context menu while right-clicking on time rulers.

- Audio clip waveform drawing gets additional closing points.

- It is now possible to change the length/size of a clip by dragging its
  left or right edges, while in the main track-view. Shift/Ctrl+drag will
  also time-stretch to the resulting audio clip length.

- Another off-by-one mistake was corrected, which was causing audio clips
  to go out-of-sync on loop turnover boundary; also changed the loop
  turnaround strategy, now honoring already cached periods.

- A race-condition has been mitigated in the audio-buffer thread, that was
  exposed and lead to sudden application freezing upon changing some
  composite audio clip commands.

- Take absolute audio peak values only, making peak files a little bit
  shorter and hopefully faster to load and draw as waveforms.


0.0.9   2007-11-30  The Adolescence Prime

- Drag-and-dropping of MIDI files without specific track or channel, into
  existing tracks, is now rejected. The drop operation is now allowed on
  the track-view blank area only, meaning the same as the complete MIDI
  file import into session.

- Record actual MIDI clip length to last play-head position, instead of
  time of last event in the recorded sequence.

- Connections item lists gets properly sorted, as intended.

- Clear connection persistance once an explicit discconnection is issued
  on any of the (intrinsic) bus ports.

- MIDI output buses now get the panning slider to spit out some GM system
  master balance (sysex) messages, being now enabled.

- Mouse hovering on the clip fade-in/out handles, while in the main
  track-view, gets its long due cursor pointer feedback.

- Fixed a off-by-one boundary issue on MIDI clip event playback, which
  were enqueuing duplicated MIDI events on every read-ahead output thread
  processing cycle (1 sec).

- Transport menu and toolbar are now featured on the MIDI Editor.

- Use actual session name when asking to save changed session.

- Transport loop setting keyboard shortcuts swapped: Ctrl+L will set the
  loop immediately, and Shift+Ctrl+L will toggle on/off.

- Changing MIDI event duration may now affect MIDI clip duration.

- Alternate sharp-note color lines have returned to MIDI Editor canvas, as
  was the shadow color marking the end of MIDI clip.


0.0.8   2007-11-12  The Twelfth Tight

- Bus context menu is now accessible from respective mixer strip.

- Fixed a subtle crash-suicide issue when invoking the bus dialog with a
  double-click over the corresponding mixer bus strip; also fixed the
  sloppy ganguing mistake when changing mixer bus gain (volume) and panning
  values.

- MIDI Omni mode (sort of) makes its entrance as a new MIDI track
  property, meaning that is now finally possible for the capture of any
  unfiltered MIDI channel event, without regard to the current channel
  assignment, which still applies for playback purposes.

- Audio (pass-)through has been also implemented, now being a common and
  consistent property of both audio and MIDI buses, provided those are set
  in duplex mode (input and output).

- Re-touched follow-playhead and continue-past-end tool icons, again to be
  a bit softer and not so bright as to hurt someones eyes.


0.0.7   2007-10-31  The Eleventh Tower

- Suspend auto-follow-playhead while dragging or moving content over the
  main track and midi editor views; re-touched follow-playhead and new
  continue-past-end tool icons.

- Playback is now forced complete full-stop whenever play-head goes behind
  the current session length and/or loop-end and the newer "continue past
  end" option is enabled from transport menu.

- Tool/child windows position and size preservation fixed.

- MIDI (pass-)through has been finally implemented, after several kind
  requests, it applies as a property of duplex-mode MIDI buses; this new
  setting is configurable from the View/Buses... dialog; also from
  respective new input bus mixer-strip button; when enabled, implies all
  incoming MIDI events at the input bus will pass-through unchanged to the
  corresponding output bus, as found useful just for direct monitoring
  one's performance without the help of any extra circumvent or kludgy
  connections.

- Mouse cursor shape changes accordingly while hovering in header
  time-scale rulers, both in main track-view and MIDI editor.

- Track-view clipboard paste action has been refactored, with the user
  interface consistent with the same functionality featured on the MIDI
  editor: the clipboard selection being pasted now floats at the mouse
  pointer and can be moved around before placed into its final position,
  either with the mouse or keyboard arrow keys.

- A unitialized member variable bug affecting all MIDI clips has been
  discovered and squashed; this one has been lurking for quite some time
  and was causing wrong clip editing results, specially when tempo or meter
  differs between session and the MIDI file.

- Keyboard step-moving is now allowed while pasting in MIDI editor.

- Track-view clip selection can now be drag-moved into the void (bottom)
  view area creating brand new tracks automagically.

- Losing focus resets all current keyboard step-moves in progress,
  affecting the main track-view and all MIDI editor as well.

- As done before on the MIDI editor, the main track-view current selection
  may be step-wise moved using the keyboard arrow keys and the enter
  /insert keys for final placement; horizontal step movement is quantized
  according to current snap setting; vertical key-step movement is only
  allowed to selected clips belonging to one single and the same track.

- Immediate session loop setting, accessible from the main menu.

- Track properties dialog gets fixed again in its auto-size treat.

- Another audio-buffer thread bug was scrubbed off, which was causing
  spurious and audible garbage on certain loop workloads.


0.0.6   2007-10-09  The Tenth Commencement

- A bit more of precision is achieved over the metronome regular ticking
  and both the audio and MIDI monitor meters.

- A rudimentary MIDI metronome is now in place; parameters, like MIDI
  channel, bar and beat accent note, velocity and duration, are readily
  configurable from the main menu, View/Options... /MIDI/Metronome dialog.

- Track properties dialog now gets tightly auto-sized, depending whether
  its an audio or a MIDI track.

- MIDI clips are now auto-extendable when adding or moving events beyond
  the clip length and while in the MIDI Editor, of course.

- MIDI editor current selection can now be step-wise moved using the
  keyboard arrow keys and the enter/insert keys as for final placement;
  horizontal step movement is subordinated to current snap per beat
  setting, no less than unity; vertical step moves are obviously quantized
  to the next semitone.

- Get configure to try and detect the correct qmake location and insert it
  the search order, so let the qt4 tools take precedence when --with-qt
  option is given and older qt3 ones coexist and are found located ahead
  in the PATH.

- Drifting correction on audio and MIDI engines was seriously infected in
  some kind of snafu conception, as evidence lead to even worse drifting
  being detected to much of great despair, specially after recording
  and/or bouncing audio tracks from MIDI sequenced material. Credit must
  certainly go to Christian Schoenebeck on splatting this sloppy one on the
  face.

- MIDI editing actions while playing now get immediate feedback; this was
  possible to some internal interface redesign of all MIDI editor accessory
  classes, making the MIDI clip now being the main editing target object
  instead of just the MIDI event sequence as it was previously.

- Simple as it could ever be, the build executive summary report is now
  given on configure.

- The internal decoded frame list for MPEG 1Audio Layer III (mp3) audio
  files (ie. via libmad) has been made one-time cached as global shared
  objects, benefitting from the fact that the list is always completely
  (re)built during the peak file computation, and thus speeding up all
  frame accurate access operations (seek) over this specific audio file
  format.

- More eye-candy is sneaking in the MIDI editor: there's new view options
  on the View menu: Note Color and Value Color, affecting note event
  colors according to pitch and/or velocity.

- New view option on the MIDI editor: on menu View/Note Duration switches
  whether events are shown proportional to their durations or as simple
  vertical candlesticks.

- New snap-per-beat divisors are now available (Beat/3, 6, 12, 24 and 48),
  giving support for triplets for the very first time (after a heads-up
  suggested  patch from Marko, thanks).


0.0.5   2007-09-08  The Ninth Hitch Nail

- MIDI edit tools (quantize, transpose, normalize, randomize, resize) are
  all functional and ready for experimentalism; gets in its own top-level
  menu and form with named preset store and recall functionality.

- Main form backward and rewind transport actions are now being
  immediately enabled when playing from the session (zero-time) start
  position.

- Audio and MIDI export sneaks in and in form and accessible from the main
  Track menu.

- MIDI track channel is now properly set on session (re)load; track
  background color changes was missing the alpha setting.

- The mix-down buffering was fixed again, now taking multi-track
  overlapping clips into consideration (was a lot more broken since the
  recent glitch-looping fix).

- Dirty MIDI clip editing control has been fixed but still somewhat hacky
  nevertheless.

- First attempt on solving a nasty MIDI editor bug, which was quietly and
  severely crippling MIDI files while saving offset edited clips.

- Session loop (re)setting is finally now an undoable command.

- Yet another insidious bug has been swept away from under the carpet:
  once again on audio looping, some astonishing old and crappy session
  cursor seek-backward statement was lurking to be laid off. Gone now,
  simply as it is, growing old on this :)

- A tremendous bug has been fixed: audio looping is now a little more
  glitch-free as the mix-down buffering was badly broken even since its
  primordial implementation. Rejoice.

- Minor improvements on track-view cursor updates and visual tracking
  while recording.

- MIDI editor windows get their keyboard accelerator/shortcuts back in
  business, whether opted as tools always on top or not.

- The infamous "Keep tool windows always on top" global option is now
  infecting the Connections, Mixer, Plugin and MIDI Editor window
  instances with no probable regrets. To be used with discretion, of
  course.

- Session update/initialization gets it clean on startup.

- Range selection action (Ctrl+R) is now back in business with the added
  bonus of being accessible from all MIDI editor instances too.

- Common edit-head and tail cursor positions are now under common control
  and display from all MIDI editor instances; the session loop-start/end
  points are now also shown on every time-line and share the same control
  behavior across all MIDI editor instances.


0.0.4   2007-07-19  The Eighth Wanderer

- Main toolbar tempo spin-box gets loose from keyboard change tracking (Qt
  >= 4.3); custom spin-box compilation fix for Qt 4.1.

- Illusive but nasty Connections/Patchbay item tooltip crash bug has been
  hopefully fixed (Qt >= 4.3); QComboBox::editTextChanged() signal
  replaces old QComboBox::textChanged().

- Combo-box setup history has been corrected on restore, which was
  discarding the very initial default (factory) contents.

- Make debian package build depend on libqt4-dev; win32 console flag is
  back to qmake project file.

- MIDI instrument selection (e.g. on track form) gets fixed and improved.

- Sorting method for the connections port list has been refactored;
  potential crash bug fix on connections sorting method.

- Messages class accessor methods constness fix.

- Got rid of some autoconf redundand thingies on configure; late debian
  changelog update.

- Desktop categories update: AudioVideo.

- README correction.


0.0.3   2007-06-23  The Seventh Draught

- Crash fix on the connections widget, was a matter of refactoring the
  refresh/clear slots.

- Help menu added to MIDI editor form (redirected and same to main form
  anyway).

- Clip properties form gets its proper sanity check, querying any existing
  clip editor whether its safe to apply the new settings.

- Mixer sliders get their long due valued correction, hopefully.

- Transport backward and play/stop are now made accessible from the MIDI
  editor widget, through their keyboard accelerator shortcuts (backspace
  and space, respectively).

- Transport actions (play, rec, rew and ffwd) are now kept stable on a
  single point, instead of being scattered all over the main form code;
  transport visual feedback might get affected, specially regarding the
  MMC processing.

- Application icon is now officially installed into
  ${prefix}/share/pixmaps.

- Spec file is now a bit more openSUSE compliant; just made RPM
  requirements as exigent as the new debian ones.

- Paste cursor is now properly preserved after leaving MIDI editor views.

- Amazingly why this was not spotted before, the main application
  logo-icon has been downscaled to the 32x32 pixel standard icon size.

- MIDI clip editor clipboard gets singleton status and is now shared on
  all MIDI editor instances. Similarly to the main track-view,
  Shift/Ctrl-left-clicking on the MIDI editor views sets the current
  session play-head position.

- A desktop entry file has been included on install, at last.

- Clips in main track-view get more info in the form of tooltips.

- Major rounding fix to time-scaling and most specially on all those
  internal MIDI I/O methods.

- Extended range selection from the time-ruler and key-list headers is now
  possible by click-and-drag the mouse pointer.

- Play-head cursor is now also displayed and/or set position on all open
  MIDI clip editors time line view. As in the main application form, a new
  local follow play-head option is also featured on the MIDI editor view
  menu and toolbar.

- All MIDI file save operations are now logged to main messages and files
  are added to the main files list view.

- Initial debianization.

- MIDI capture/record file format (SMF Format 0 or 1) is now an user
  option, introducing the new MIDI tab on the global View/Options dialog.

- A bad old-time session cursor glitch has been apparently fixed.

- Make sure the generic clip properties form is modal.

- Major rewrite and adaptation to the session time-scale properties,
  making its way for a brand new command instance: the session-tempo
  command.

- Changing the snap-per-beat combobox value on the main window toolbar
  does not make it as an undoable command anymore.

- Long due MIDI clip editor integration has come to reality.

- Major rewrite on the MIDI sequence file read/write methods, in
  preparation to the coming MIDI clip editor.

- Status-bar session length label now gets rightly updated, while extended
  recording, of course.

- Clip properties fade-in/out lengths, gets their old due constraints.

- Main transport time display is now an editable custom spin-box; the
  Tempo (BPM) spin-box has seen new colors (green on black).

- Transport time display format option adds the new choice of absolute
  frame number, alternative to previous time and BBT.

- The frame-time based spin-boxes, on the clip properties form, were
  replaced with a new custom one, allowing for alternate frame, time and
  bbt input/display formats.

- Time-scale helper class has been introduced.


0.0.2   2007-05-26  The Sixth Lord

- Audio/MIDI connections gets slightly refactored, contributing for whole
  robustness, specially in case of incidental engine shutdown.

- Mixer window gets a minimum default height bump.

- Clip fade-in/out type changes have been properly fixed.

- Complete refactoring of the command class pattern, making it now derived
  from QObject and not having a reference to the main form anymore.

- Inoperative context menu event handler has been removed from the
  track-view.

- MIDI sequence note-on event tracking now uses faster QHash class,
  instead of original QMap.

- Off-by-one bug fix on MIDI track write method, while parsing co-incident
  note-on/off events in the wrong order and thus leaving note events with
  an invalid (zero) duration; obviously affecting MIDI recording in very
  special circumstances.

- Minor and rather innocuous drop at this time in the MIDI event class
  structure: the flags member field.

- Port connections now get their lines correctly drawn; strangely enough,
  the connection lines were being painted only for the parent client
  items, probably since the Qt4 migration (aka. Halloween files).

- Early clip editing is in place (clip name, start, offset and length
  parameters, fade in/out length and type).

- Some menu item text capitalization.


0.0.1   2007-05-07  The Filthy Fifth

- Newer JACK 0.105.0 seems to bitch, probably correctly, about the return
  value of the process callback. Make it to bitch no more by ensuring the
  JACK client is always issuing the innocuous 0 (zero) return value.

- Important fixes have been issued, affecting MIDI recording: MIDI
  sequence zero-time event insertion; MIDI file pending note-off
  processing  on write-track method.

- Qt4 migration complete.


0.0.0   2006-10-31  The Halloween Files
