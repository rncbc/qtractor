Description: An Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer.
  Qtractor is an Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer application
  written in C++ with the Qt framework. Target platform will be
  Linux, where the Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) for audio,
  and the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) for MIDI,
  are the main infrastructures to evolve as a fairly-featured
  Linux Desktop Audio Workstation GUI, specially dedicated to
  the personal home-studio.
