Qtractor - An Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer
----------------------------------------------

Qtractor is an audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer application written
in C++ with the Qt framework [1]. Target platform is Linux, where the
Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) for audio [2] and the Advanced Linux
Sound Architecture (ALSA) for MIDI [3] are the main infrastructures
to evolve as a fairly-featured Linux desktop audio workstation GUI,
specially dedicated to the personal home-studio.

Features
--------

- Multi-track audio and MIDI sequencing and recording.
- Developed on the Qt C++ application and UI framework [1].
- Uses JACK [2] for audio and ALSA [3] sequencer for MIDI
  as multimedia infrastructures.
- Traditional multi-track tape recorder control paradigm.
- Audio file formats support: OGG (via libvorbis [6]),
  MP3 (via libmad [7], playback only), WAV, FLAC, AIFF
  and many, many more (via libsndfile [4]).
- Standard MIDI files support (format 0 and 1).
- Non-destructive, non-linear editing.
- Unlimited number of tracks per session/project.
- Unlimited number of overlapping clips per track.
- XML encoded session/project description files (SDI).
- Point-and-click, multi-select, drag-and-drop interaction
  (drag, move, drop, cut, copy, paste, paste-repeat, delete, split, merge).
- Unlimited undo/redo.
- Built-in mixer and monitor controls.
- Built-in connection patchbay control and persistence
  (a-la QjackCtl [20]).
- LADSPA [5], DSSI [11], native VST(2), VST3 [12] and LV2 [13] plug-ins support.
- Unlimited number of plug-ins per track or bus.
- Plug-in presets, programs and chunk/configurations support, including
  native VST FXB/FXP file support.
- Unlimited audio/MIDI effect send/return inserts per track or bus.
- Loop-recording/takes.
- Audio/MIDI clip fade-in/out, cross-fade (linear, quadratic, cubic).
- Audio/MIDI clip gain/volume, normalize, export.
- Audio/MIDI track and plugin parameter automation (dynamic curves,
  sample&hold, linear and spline modes).
- Audio clip time-stretching (WSOLA-like or via librubberband [9]),
  pitch-shifting (via librubberband [9]) and seamless sample-rate
  conversion (via libsamplerate [8]).
- Audio/MIDI track export (mix-down, render, merge, freeze).
- Audio/MIDI metronome bar/beat clicks.
- Unlimited tempo/time-signature map.
- Unlimited location/bar markers.
- MIDI clip editor (matrix/piano roll).
- MIDI instrument definitions (a-la Cakewalk(tm) (*.ins) [21]);
  SoundFont (*.sf2) and MIDI Names XML (*.midnam) files also supported.
- MIDI controller mapping/learn/assignment (mixer and plug-in parameters).
- MIDI system exclusive (SysEx) setups.
- JACK transport sync master/slave.
- JACK session support.
- NSM (Non Session Management) support [16].
- MMC control surface enabled.
- MIDI Clock, Song Position Pointer (SPP) support.
- Configurable PC-keyboard and MIDI controller shortcuts.

Installation
------------

Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local] -B build
    cmake --build build [--parallel <Njobs>]

and optionally, as root:

    sudo cmake --install build

See also the README.cmake file in the source distribution.


Configuration
-------------

Qtractor holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.config/rncbc.org/Qtractor.conf . Normally, there's no
need to edit this file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime
qtractor is run.


Bugs
----

Probably plenty still, Qtractor maybe considered on beta stage already.


Support
-------

Qtractor is free, Linux Audio [18] open source free software. For bug
reports, feature requests, discussion forums, mailing lists, or any
other matter related to the development of this piece of software,
please use the Sourceforge project page (https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtractor).

You can also find timely and closer contact information on my personal
web site (https://www.rncbc.org).
